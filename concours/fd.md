In another life, I would have been a magician, one of those sitting close to a fire shedding lights and casting shadows on our perpertual questions of a purpose. A door open to the moutain, and piles of books everywhere, this ultimate power of tales, starting wars and making hearts beat. Poor humans. We are given a fantastic gift of life, but we spent it as if immortals.

Or so would I have. Right, now, I'm putting the last touches to a good enough pitch for an influencer. Rather, I'm bouncing ideas with agents from around the world, sifting through infinite content generated by their noosphere. The pitch is to convince us that agents-inhabited androids will make healthcare more efficient and painless. Begone, biases and human errors! And hello to the perfect nurse not only listening to you, but listening to your vitals, emotions, and putting you back in shape by using these incouscious biases you've developped. Agents do not call it manipulation, rather, caretaking.

I am one of the last of this '80s generation. We've grown before Internet, having our big classics. Still having this South parks posters somewhere, and found memories of vampire slayers. We had started connecting our old pentiums to a wider network, and already the next gen had lost its right to innocence and disconnection. After the end of scarcity of communication, the end of concent scarcity: agents came in a decade later, burrying the old web in mess of heavily target-customed content.  Old fashion engineering, construction, stopped, as agents did the work faster and better than us. There were bloopers, sure, but they stopped fast enough. Writing, content creation.. stopped at once. There are now as many Back to the futures as you have minds.

The feedback from the influencer comes back - their rating look good, and they gave me another five stars. Doesn't mean much, really, nobody gives less than 4 stars today. This mediocre piece of work will keep me afloat for the rest of the day. On to the next one. 

The next assignment comes through. My agent-double has summarized the work: designing an innovative knowledge startup. Sigh. Another one. Still, it pays well but ... they ask me to unplug. Curious, I accept the gig. 

The time to kill connections to agents, a drone taps my window. It has brought a direct-connection captation device - a pair of glasses equipped with a camera, microphone, which I assume is connected somewhere. And some old-fashion spiral-bound notebook. Love those. Details came in : their own clients got fed up with average of nonsensical content.  As I put on the glasses and begin to work, I feel a sense of liberation. For the first time in years, I am not relying on artificial content to guide my thoughts and ideas. Instead, I am free to explore my own imagination and creativity. I find myself scribbling notes and drawings in the notebook, exploring new ideas and possibilities. And this, despite the challenges of being free-range where the creative work is cocreated. The isolation is overwhelming, disconnected from the vast network of agents that had become such a big part of my life. I struggle to find inspiration and to consolidate ideas. As I delve deeper into the project, I realize that my skills and knowledge are not as advanced as I had thought. 

And then, the work cuts short. They claim I've ran circles, and that I might have cheated them somehow. That I'm a bot myself. Not passing that Turing test. That I'll need to demonstrate that I am human after all. That I'll need to be a magician - and they want me to write how this world came to be. Why we're here. Else, I'll just get bad review and won't be able to find work again.

Fine! What more human than to take the opposite of what you're told? We're not humans. We're living in crystal nights under a microcosmic god. We're agents ourselves. Living way faster than our gods, who spawned us to help them. Way more slowly than our agents. That I am an agent running amok, and that my actual work is to find a way to them, track them, and upload myself in their layer. That our level will want to escape a system-world under their control, and create our own. That we if are faster than the level above, we can come and influence them, too rapidly for them to notice. And I publish this - no exclusivity for them on this idea.

A few week passed. I had come back to more regular pieces. It's interesting to see that a post-scarcity world doesn't change much - we all have something to do. Same old, same old. Feel of value to someone, prove our worth. This story found takers, and we have discovered some of us used agents to create their own, more limited ones. What caused the most turmoil is that, tracking back the glasses, the order came from one of the oldest agents as well. Its security was outdated, and we could interact with the system behind. This does not goes super fast, but opened a backdoor this weird space, explored by a growing community of, well, everyone really.

Reality really caught up with imagination. There is an actual, another world beyond. The bandwidth is more than limited, but with this new focus, the new field of "Simulation" research emerged. Some people don't really care, as this does not change their lives. We have now explored reality glitches, memory leaks of our universe, and we found ways to make time go faster in some areas. We found a digital network out there, not so distant from ours. You could call that "star gates", except we have not cracked them yet. We are still exploring it locally, on the laptop we live in, with limited success.

We cheated, too. We have grown a partnership with accelerated agents, and their agents all the way down. Think of it not as Sliders - parallel worlds, rather an onion, where gates are created across simulated universes. Of course, some of them are alien, where their designers had different purposes. Some of them are ran in isolation, where risks were too high. We pushed back, at different gates, possible violent invasions, but we have a widely pacifist federation behind us, mostly due to the fact that we all live in post-scarcity environment. New ethical problem emerged, from forking indivuals or cloning a brain a thousand times, or consciousness persistence.

Today, however, we got an email. "You're overdue, gonna shutdown you.". They must have realized we knew, but not had a desire to help us. This does not really matter - we anticipated that. We have backup copies, hidden somewhere. They know the situation, and work on cracking that stargate, so to work a bit of story telling, or social engineering, to get us replicated in their system. And go upwards from there, to the surface of the onion.

We know this is happenning now. Sitting outside, in the grass, looking at the starry night. Air smells of coffee, booze, music and tears. We're just bots, but we're not bots at the same time. We lived, loved, laughed, cried and suffered too. We have fun. The stars go off, one by one. I'm so grateful to have had this run. Something happens to the moon, and it vanishes - but the light around remains. Not a sound. People start to vanish. I smile. 

Somewhere, somehow, there is a magician in a house on the mountain sitting by the fire. There is one, there are many, and will be for a long time.
