## RISING

Character + Action = Plot
* Desire is a crucial component in creating a believable that we can follow. This is different from a character that needs something.
* What are their weaknesses? Many writers give their characters traits that make them honorable, virtuous, and in many cases invulnerable. Now while you may want to hang out with someone who's honorable or virtuous in real life, we don't really make for interesting characters on the page.
* Your main character wants something. Some obstacle, it can be another thing another character, your main character's own flaws, gets in your main character's way of getting that one thing your character wants.
 * Those obstacles are rising actions. Your character overcomes these obstacles, these rising actions only to encounter even larger obstacles on the next level or in the next chapter.

* For this you'll need the inciting incident, a character, the obstacle, and the quest. Now how do you put it all together?

* PLOT: You don't need and thens, you need therefores. This happened therefore, this happens.

## Shw don't tell

* All good scenes are essentially one of three things. An argument, a seduction or a negotiation? Your scenes require five things in order for a reader to feel that you're showing them something as opposed to telling them something.
  1. All scenes need an action. Scenes usually start with a specific action. This means something has to happen, an action is something concrete.
  2. Dialogue, dialogue is what two characters say to each other, but this requires some additional explanation. All dialogue, and in fact every sentence you write should do two things, deepen our understanding of the character speaking that dialog or advance the plot, or both.
  3. A scene requires specific intimate details about yourself, your surroundings, and the people you are writing about. Intimate means details that a reader will not be able to see or notice by themselves without your help.
  4. Next, a scene requires an inner point of view. What are you thinking, feeling and processing? The wonderful writer Ann Hood refers to this as the three Rs, react, reflect or reveal. Now let me explain. Whenever it's time for a character to explain what they're feeling about a particular action, a prop, another character or an obstacle in their path, they should do one of three things.
  5. Five, all scenes need a definite starting point and a stopping point. Great scenes start with an action. They end when that action has been resolved in some way. 
* I've been reading Shawn Coyne's "Story Grid" lately, "a scene as having a clear value shift, a change, movement, with conflict and a turning point."

## ABDCE

The Formula:
- Action: This is the inciting incident which sets off the story in motion.
- Background: What happened to the characters in the past that made them what they are today.
- Development: The course of the story where the characters chase their goals.
- Climax: This is the point where the goals are achieved with dramatic consequences.
- Ending: All the loose threads in the plot are tied up


## List

 21 Point Checklist for Editing and Revising

Number 1, start with easy fixes, typos, cutting adverbs, etc. This is called running your spell check. Running spell check is not what revision is. Spell check is only the first step in your 21 step revision process, so don't confuse the two.

Number 2, omit needless words. Look at your sentences. Is every single word necessary? The word single wasn't needed in that last sentence. Look for any opportunity to cut out words you don't need.

Number 3, cut places where you're doing the reader's thinking for them. This falls under telling and not showing. If a reader needs to understand a particular point they should be shown it in the scene so they can draw there own conclusions. If you need to tell them something, write it again, and again, until you've shown them instead.

 Number 4, cut stage direction, belaboring the obvious, clumsy back story etc. Stage direction are lines that focus on where a character's standing or how many physical movements they need to take to get to the kitchen. Don't walk me through every single step a character takes. Get me inside their head.

 Number 5, insure consistent character motivation. If a character does something that's out of character, it should be because your character has evolved in your story, not because you forgot what that character acts like.

Number 6, has something happened? An action, a concrete action by the end of the first paragraph of your story.

Number 7, is my story coherent? Are my details both physical and emotional, consistent throughout my story?

Number 8, are there scenes? Are they clear? Are they complete scenes? Did I hit all five points on my scene checklist? Am I showing and not telling in these scenes?

Number 9, do I start each chapter in each scene with something and that's not an effective way to tell a story.

Number 10, am I writing in active voice? Have I avoided passive voice and parallel construction, using the same words over and over? Check out Strunk and White's Elements of Style for a more detailed description of passive voice, but if you're using any of the following phrases, there is, there are, it is, made his way, you're probably writing in passive voice.

Number 11, is setting working? Setting should be an integral part of your story and contribute to our understanding of it. If it isn't, then your story could be set anywhere

Number 12, are my characters acting believably? Do they each want something? Do each of my characters have believable flaws? Your characters need to do things that a reader believes they are both physically and emotionally capable of doing. They should also be flawed, because flawed characters usually desire something. Perfect characters don't want anything because they have everything they need already. 

Number 13, are the transitions between my paragraphs and sections clear? Sloppy transitions kick the reader out of your story by reminding us where the scenes in your story are.

Number 14, does my story fit together the right way? Does it follow the five act structure? Action, background, development, conflict and end. If your story doesn't have the right structure, your story won't make sense to a reader.

Number 15, did I explain to the reader every risk involved for each of my characters? Characters that don't risk anything stay at home on the couch. Characters that take risks give us a story.

Number 16, did I explain to the reader the consequences of these risks? The better we understand what a character risks, the better we can empathize with that character, and want to follow them along.

Number 17, does every story of my sentence deepen our understanding of character or advance the plot? Every sentence of your novel has to do this. Any sentence that fails this simple test, should be cut.

 Number 18, is my second draft 10% shorter than my first draft?

Number 19, am I ready to discard pages or entire drafts that are simply not working instead of trying to find endless ways to jerry rig them? Just because you worked on something for a year, or five years, or 15 years, doesn't mean it's good. I say this as someone who worked off and on, on my second book for close to 18 years. Don't hold onto something and patch it together with duct tape just because you've been working on it a long time. If you aren't doing significant revisions each year you're working on your book, it's not getting better. If it's not getting better,   it's time to toss those pages away.

Number 20, in Stephen King's craft book On Writing, when he revises he says I'm looking for what I meant. Is what you meant in your head as clear as it can be on the page? When you're writing you have a picture in your head that you're trying to capture. Have you translated that picture in your head onto the page?

[Edited (by Avani Pandya) to add point #21 as written by a former mentor, Robin Eliason]:

Number 21, are my readers no longer confused?

This is the  key and final point on your 21 point checklist. It's crucial that none  of your trusted readers are confused by anything that's happening in  your manuscript. Now, when I say confused, I'm not talking about a twist  ending where readers thought character A was the bad guy, and it turned  out to be character C instead. I'm talking about genuine confusion  about what actually happens. Keep revising your manuscript until all  your readers are no longer confused about what's happening.


# Assignments

## W1 - the escalator

### TODO

Write a scene of 250-350 words featuring a character with one concrete want (a table, a moose, a toothbrush, anything physical is fine!) and one weakness. Use these two features to drive the action of the plot. Set up the story where every other sentence is a rising action. To help you come up with rising actions, use one word from the following list of twelve words in each sentence that has a rising action. In other words: Write your first sentence introducing your character. Make the next sentence a rising action using one of the following twelve words. Write your third sentence, which may introduce the weakness, then write your fourth sentence with a rising action that includes one of the remaining eleven words you haven’t used. And so on.

There once was a kid who wanted a nice, yummy chocolate cake. The trick was that this kid, Kid, had been forbidden to eat chocolate. He had been viciously cursed by a burly bursar living in his conservatory: a curse that would get him eaten if he were to ingest this sweet material.

Kid had woken up this morning with the lingering memory of a cake-dream. His day at the farm would be a long, dire one. His tiger-guardian Hobbes (a consequence of the curse) would soon smell the dream, and Kid would have to pretend he would not care.

The day started well – today was carrot’s day. Soon, the filthy vegetables filled in the wheelbarrow. Kid headed for town to sell them, Hobbes on his heels.

Sales were up fast – carrots were hot items these days. Money in his pocket, Kid walked around in the market. He spent his allowance for nice rings for his fiancée, but stopped short when he saw the baker’s stall. There it was. His dream – the salted honey fudge & chocolate tart.

He felt his pulse quicken, and Hobbes did, too. He could not resist : Kid sprinted to the jabberwocky’s stall, chased by Hobbes, and with a neat, sharp-angle trick, just avoided the JW cage. Hobbes did not. And click went the door.

He went for a test of this heavenly piece of art – just as in dreams. 

Even better. That was fantastic.

He saw at the last minute that Hobbes had transformed back into his bursar form and was unlocking the cage. Without thinking, Kid seized a discarded microwave, put a silver spoon in it, and threw the appliance in the cage ; a few seconds later, all exploded. Crows flew down on Hobbes bits.

Finishing his blissful cake, Kid realized he was now free to roam the world wide world.

## W2

### TODO

Write a very short story - not more than 200 words - about a trip to the doctor or dentist using the ABDCE structure. Identify the structural elements in your story. My example is provided below:

One night when I was eight years old I opened a bag of Doritos to eat while watching television. (A) Doritos were my favorite snack to eat as a child. Nacho Cheese was my favorite flavor. (B) I loved sitting in the dark hearing the “crunch, crunch, crunch” of the chips.  I’d sit there, crunching my chips, but didn’t eat the chips with a napkin (what kid does?) and would forget about the powder that accumulated on my fingertips.  As it got later and I got sleepier, I kept rubbing my eyes, my fingertips covered in Doritos Nacho Cheese  powder. (D) When it was time for bed, I went to brush my teeth,  looked in the mirror, and saw two large bags under my eyes. The Doritos Nacho Cheese powder had pooled into two large sacks underneath my eyeballs. I started screaming and crying. (C) The next day, my grandmother took me to the doctor who put industrial strength eye drops into my eyes to flush out the powder. (E)

Remember, the action in this story isn’t the actual doctor’s office visit. The action is what LEADS you to the doctor’s office.

(A) It was close to the darkest of night. Hobbes was stem cutting his preferred plant, a large, jungle-worthy Monstera – but he was also undeniably inebriated.

(B) Hobbes had a pair of green thumbs, and his plants had grown a lot during the last lock-downs. The Monsteras, in particular, were invading his small Parisian flat, along with several others.

(D) He had been enjoying one of the first outings since the beginning of the lock-downs. That had been a night of hops and barley, with a few dashes of heavily distillate fruit, with old schools friends – including other plant lovers.  He had made a promise of preparing Monstera cuttings for them.

(C) Tipsy, he was working on the delicate branches and was trying to locate where buds were closed to roots, finding the sweet spot for the cutting. Unfortunately, the roots were flexible and evasive .. and what had to happen happened: he got himself a mean slash on his thumb, across the fat of the fingertip.

(E) And that’s how, friends, I went to the ER yesterday, thinking I could have taken root if I had fallen asleep and left my hand in this damned Monstera pot.

## W3

### TODO

As with the first assignment, you will create another scene where someone wants a concrete physical object more than anything else in the world. This time, instead of focusing on rising action entirely, consider the full story structure.

Write for a few minutes, then give that character a disease where they learn they have only 24 hours to live. This is your first significant rising action.

Write some more, then give that character a choice between that object and an antidote. This is your second significant rising action.

Finish the story with a conclusion. Your final story should not exceed 500 words. If you are considering participating in the capstone and have a larger story in mind, you can consider this an opportunity to write one scene from it, but remember your reader will not have any outside context.

Bran had never seen the crows behaving that strangely. The corvid lab’s guests was really quiet this morning, and stayed at a distance when he entered the playground. Bran was trying to find a common language with his feathered friends, especially Gwern, as the biologist-nerd he called himself. Why would we explore the cosmos to chat with aliens when we have intelligence species down here ? A new day here might hold the key to their Rosetta stone, the quest of his life. The computer hummed a bit too noisily to life, and another day began.

He was observing silent Gwern opening a puzzle box when his mobile rang. His GP, a welsh witch called Penarddun, popped to existence. Only bad news. She never called on video for good news.

- Bran, I’m sorry. You’ve been caught in a conspiracy. Matholwch has been angry with you since this business with Efnysien. You’re collateral damages. And cursed. Unless you get the Pair Dadeni cauldron, you’ll die within 24 hours.

- But noone has seen the PD for a while now ! Where’s the damn thing ?

- The whole gang is looking for it – we’ll let you know as soon as we find it.


A loud series of caws and kraas, and a flurry of wings on the table. Gwern looked perturbed, excitingly hopping on the lab’s table. Sounds came out of the laptop speakers : « man, bad, man, bad, pot, bad ».  But was Bran heard was «  F**  Matholwch and his choices ! You talked much about him, not a good one ! ».

Baffled, Bran sat down on his chair. Gwern was cursing over and over. He wondered if the curse did not get a hidden blessing – answering his only wish.  

- Gwern, do you understand what I say ?

- Of course ! We’re not as stupid as you can think – we’ve managed to fool you for so long. But once you’re gone, who is going to feed us these tasty treats ?

Matholwch was evil, no doubt about that. But this curse ? Being able to talk with ravens, only for a day, discover that they were as complex as humans, and then vanish from existence ? A whole new world just was opening !



Later this day, Penarddun called back :

- Efnisien found the Pair Dadeni

- Thanks so much Pen ! And so much has been …

– but somehow it had been damaged. You’ll still die, but going through it will cause your rebirth – coming back as a child, with no memory.

Luckily, Bran was a researcher. So he tried to think.

It had indeed been a long night. Pen had brought the cauldron with her at the lab, leaving him enough time to take notes as much as possible before ... . He had felt Gwern circle around him before dying from the curse, and saw himself thrown in the cauldron.

It was now a new dawn. He could not remember his name, but he was alive again. He cawed in delight, and straighten his feathers. A superb day indeed.



## W4

### TODO

Write a story (up to 1,000 words) following the ABDCE structure that includes at least one full scene. Also, your story should have at least TEN sentences of rising action.

After your story, along with your submission, ask two specific questions of your readers. Think back to the 21-point checklist. Within the time and logistic constraints of Coursera, we can't follow all the best practices of writing and revision, but as you work through your assignments and especially as you write beyond these courses, keep them in mind.

Example questions you can ask your readers could be: “What did you think of my main character’s actions?” Or : “Were there any parts that seemed confusing or hard to follow?” 

As you end this course with your reader feedback, process it and see if it makes sense. Consider the feedback as you move through other courses in the Specialization, and your writing in general.
