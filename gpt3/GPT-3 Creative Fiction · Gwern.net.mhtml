175b has worked surprisingly well and unlocked remarkable flexibility in th=
e form of <em>meta-learning</em>, where GPT-3 can infer new patterns or tas=

h GPT-3? Here, we=E2=80=99re all about having fun while probing GPT-3=E2=80=

to) poetry. Fortunately, OpenAI granted me access to their Beta API service=
 which provides a hosted GPT-3 model, letting me spend a great deal of time=
 interacting with GPT-3 and writing things. Naturally, I=E2=80=99d like to =
write poetry with it: but GPT-3 is too big to finetune like I did GPT-2, an=

          <p>GPT-3, announced by OpenAI in May=E2=80=852020, was the larges=
t neural network ever trained, by over an order of magnitude. Trained on In=
ternet text data, it is the successor to GPT-2, which surprised everyone by=
 its natural language understanding &amp; generation ability. GPT-3 is even=
 more surprising in that this vast increase in size did not run into <a hre=

=A0, as many expected, but the benefits of scale continued to happen as for=
ecasted by OpenAI. These benefits were not merely learning more facts &amp;=
 text than GPT-2, but qualitatively distinct &amp; surprising in showing <e=
m>meta-learning</em>: while GPT-2 learned how to do common natural language=
 tasks like text summarization, GPT-3 instead learned how to follow directi=
ons and learn new tasks from a few examples. (As a result, GPT-3 outputs &a=
mp; interaction are more fascinating &amp; human-like than GPT-2.)</p>
          <p>While the immediate applications of GPT-3, like my poetry or h=
umor writings, are nice, the short-term implications of GPT-3 are much more=
 important.</p>
          <p>First, while GPT-3 is expensive by conventional DL standards, =
it is cheap by scientific/=E2=80=8Bcommercial/=E2=80=8Bmilitary/=E2=80=8Bgo=
vernment budget standards, and the results indicate that models could be ma=
de much larger. Second, models can also be made much more powerful, as GPT =

</a> Decision Transformer is a demonstration of how RL can lurk in what loo=

large unsupervised models will be vital components of future DL systems, as=
 they can be =E2=80=98plugged into=E2=80=99 systems to immediately provide =
understanding of the world, humans, natural language, and reasoning.</p>
          <p>The meta-learning has a longer-term implication: it is a demon=
stration of the <em>blessings of scale</em>, where problems with simple neu=
ral networks vanish, and they become more powerful, more generalizable, mor=
e human-like when simply made very large &amp; trained on very large datase=
ts with very large compute=E2=80=94even though those properties are believe=
d to require complicated architectures &amp; fancy algorithms (and this per=
ceived need drives much research). Unsupervised models benefit from this, a=
s training on large corpuses like Internet-scale text present a myriad of d=
ifficult problems to solve; this is enough to drive meta-learning despite G=
PT not being designed for meta-learning in any way. (This family of phenome=
na is perhaps driven by neural networks functioning as ensembles of many su=
b-networks with them all averaging out to an Occam=E2=80=99s razor, which f=
or small data &amp; models, learn superficial or memorized parts of the dat=

pport finetuning although OA was working on it. But after enough time playi=
ng with GPT-3, I have begun to wonder: at this level of meta-learning &amp;=
 general knowledge, do we need finetuning at all?</p>
            <p>For GPT-2, I saw finetuning as doing 2 things:</p>
            <ol type=3D"1">
              <li>
                <p><strong>Fixing ignorance</strong>: missing domain knowle=
dge</p>
                <p>GPT-2 didn=E2=80=99t know many things about most things=
=E2=80=94it was just a handful (1.5 billion) of parameters trained briefly =
on the tiniest fraction of the Common Crawl subset of the Internet, without=
 any books even=E2=81=A0<a href=3D"https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3#fn10" class=
=3D"footnote-ref spawns-popup" id=3D"fnref10" role=3D"doc-noteref"><sup>=E2=
=81=A010</sup></a>=E2=81=A0. It=E2=80=99s not surprising that for many doma=
ins, it wouldn=E2=80=99t know the details; and even if the dataset included=
 adequate text, it did not train on that data many times, and the knowledge=
 competed with all the other domains it needed to know about, interfering.<=
/p>
                <p>But GPT-3 already knows everything! GPT-3 is so much lar=
ger on every dimension that this seems like much less of a problem for any =
domain which is already well-represented in public HTML pages. GPT-2 might =
need to be trained on a fanfiction corpus to learn about some obscure chara=
cter in a random media franchise &amp; generate good fiction, but GPT-3 alr=
eady knows about them and use them appropriately in writing new fiction.</p=
>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Prompting a specific task</strong>:</p>
                <p>Even when GPT-2 knew a domain adequately, it had the fru=
strating behavior of rapidly switching domains. You might prompt it with a =
poem genre it knows adequately already, but then after a few lines, it woul=
d generate an end-of-text BPE and switch to generating a news article on Do=
nald Trump. (Trump shows up a <em>lot</em>.) Presumably, while poetry was r=
easonably represented, it was still rare enough that GPT-2 considered poetr=
y highly unlikely to be the next word, and keeps trying to jump to some mor=
e common &amp; likely kind of text, and GPT-2 is not smart enough to infer =
&amp; respect the intent of the prompt.</p>
                <p>GPT-3 exhibits much less of this =E2=80=98mode switching=
=E2=80=99 sort of behavior. Perhaps because it is trained on a much larger =
and more comprehensive dataset (so news articles aren=E2=80=99t so dominant=
), but also I suspect the meta-learning makes it much better at staying on =
track and inferring the intent of the prompt=E2=80=94hence things like the =
<a href=3D"https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3#transformer-poetry" class=3D"link-se=

rmer poetry=E2=80=9D prompt</a>=E2=81=A0, where despite being what must be =
highly unusual text, even when switching to prose, it is able to improvise =
appropriate followup commentary.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, sometimes we can=E2=80=99t or don=E2=80=99=
t want to rely on prompt programming. A specific task may be necessary when=
 a task has evaded our prompt programming skills, or we have data but not p=
rompt programmer time. For example, in the GPT-3 paper, many tasks underper=
form what GPT-3 can do if we take the time to tailor the prompts &amp; samp=
ling hyperparameters, and just throwing the naive prompt formatting at GPT-=
3 is misleading. However, researchers do not have the time to go through sc=
ores of benchmark tasks and fix them one by one; simply finetuning on them =
collectively ought to do at least as well as the correct prompts would, and=
 requires much less human effort (albeit more infrastructure).</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>So, what would be the point of finetuning GPT-3 on poetry or=
 literature? It has likely already seen the finetuning corpus, knows most o=
f it, and will tractably generate poems on demand. There may be gains, but =
I wonder if they would be nearly as large as they were for GPT-2?</p>

instead a larger chunk, called a byte-pair encoding (BPE); a byte-pair is a=
 simple compression scheme where 50,257 word fragments or characters are ch=
osen to try to minimize the encoding length on some arbitrary text corpus, =
so a particularly common word may get a unique BPE while a longer word will=
 be encoded as 2 or 3 BPEs, and a completely novel word will be encoded let=
ter BPE by letter BPE as a fallback. Hence, even if 2 words sound and are s=
pelled similarly, they may be given totally different BPE encodings which d=

            <p>If BPEs are the problem, then because the knowledge of phone=

 you may think you have gotten some rhyming, because GPT-3 has memorized so=

enerally used codeblock formatting, but GPT-3 samples are often long lines =
(and more worth reading), so here, I have tried to edit the samples as litt=
le as possible while still keeping them readable in blockquotes.</p>
          <p>As far as the sampling goes: I used the largest =E2=80=9Cdavin=
ci=E2=80=9D GPT-3-175b model unless otherwise specified. (Davinci is the hi=
ghest quality and not too slow: ~147 WPM.) Since I only speak English well,=
 I avoid testing any foreign language material. These are not all samples I=
 generated the first time: I was regularly editing the prompts &amp; sampli=
ng settings as I explored prompts &amp; possible completions. The sampling =
settings were generally roughly as I advise above: high temperature, slight=
 <em>p</em> truncation &amp; repetition/=E2=80=8Bpresence penalty, occasion=
al use of high BO where it seems potentially helpfully (specifically, anyth=
ing Q&amp;A-like, or where it seems like GPT-3 is settling for local optima=
 while greedily sampling but longer high-temperature completions jump out t=
o better completions).</p>
          <p>I am not claiming that these samples are strictly scientific a=
nd best-of-5 or anything. (I would guess that the selections below are roug=
hly best-of-2 on average.) However, the samples <em>are</em> only minimally=
 edited during generation. I attempted to exercise curation rather than edi=
ting, so I did not edit the computer text; I kept them as-is, or I deleted =
the entire section to re-sample. But if readers still think I wrote the bes=
t parts of this page, then I will shamelessly steal the credit.</p>

            <p><span class=3D"marginnote inline">It=E2=80=99s all text. Wha=
t does the desired task <em>look</em> like?</span> GPT-3 is not designed in=
 any way to engage in dialogue like SOTA chatbots such as Meena; but it is =
such a general predictor of text that it can be used as a =E2=80=98chatbot=
=E2=80=99 anyway. GPT-3 can be triggered into a chatbot mode simply by labe=
ling roles; one can have an =E2=80=9CAI=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Chuman=E2=80=
=9D chat with each other (GPT-3 does that well), or one can take on one of =
the roles by editing the text appropriately after each =E2=80=9CAI=E2=80=9D=
 completion (remember, prompt-programming is purely textual, and can be any=
thing you want). The Playground provides a simple chat-bot mode which will =
insert =E2=80=9CAI:=E2=80=9D/=E2=80=8B=E2=80=9CHuman:=E2=80=9D text and new=
lines as necessary to make it a little more pleasant, but one can override =
that (and that=E2=80=99s useful for getting more than one short line out of=
 the =E2=80=9CAI=E2=80=9D, as I will demonstrate in the Turing dialogues in=
 the next section).</p>
            <p>Below is a dialogue I did to probe GPT-3=E2=80=99s understan=
ding of humor and puns:</p>
            <blockquote style=3D"line-height: calc(1.57895);">
              <p>AI: I am AI created by OpenAI. How can I help you today?</=
p>
              <p>Human: <strong>I am feeling bored. Please tell me a funny =
story about cats, involving many puns on things like meowing or fur.</stron=

              <p>AI: Well, there was this cat named Bob=E2=80=A6</p>
              <p>Human: <strong>What did Bob do?</strong></p>
              <p>AI: When Bob started to notice that he wasn=E2=80=99t feel=
ing well, he did the only thing he could do: search Google for a solution.<=
/p>
              <p>Human: <strong>Cats can search Google?</strong></p>
              <p>AI: Yes. He searched Google for the word =E2=80=9Ccat=E2=
=80=9D and received the result =E2=80=9CAll your base are belong to us=E2=
=80=9D. That was a strange response, so he decided to try again. This time,=
 he searched for the words =E2=80=9Cfunny cat=E2=80=9D and received the res=
ult =E2=80=9COne small step for cat, one giant leap for catkind=E2=80=9D. B=
ut still, he wasn=E2=80=99t satisfied. So he tried again, but this time he =
added the word =E2=80=9Ccat pictures=E2=80=9Dto his query. He received the =
result =E2=80=9CThat was no cat, that was a shoggoth.=E2=80=9D</p>
              <p>Human: <strong>But shoggoths are horrifying. What made tha=
t cat picture humorous?</strong></p>
              <p>AI: The cat was covered in fur, and resembled a shoggoth. =
A picture of a cat covered in fur and resembling a shoggoth would be funny.=
</p>
              <p>Human: <strong>Er. I suppose. Most cats are covered in fur=
 anyway=E2=80=A6 But go on.</strong></p>
              <p>AI: He tried again. But he typed in =E2=80=9Cpictures of c=
ats=E2=80=9D, which he received the result =E2=80=9CYou didn=E2=80=99t eat =
all my fish, did you?=E2=80=9D This was actually a good pun, so he thought =
maybe he was getting closer. He tried one more time by typing in =E2=80=9Cf=
unny cat videos=E2=80=9D, and received the result =E2=80=9CWhat do you mean=
,=E2=80=98fetch=E2=80=99?=E2=80=9D. And finally, he searched for =E2=80=9Cf=
unny pictures of cats=E2=80=9D and received the result =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=
=99t remember putting that ring there.=E2=80=9D. Now satisfied, he was able=
 to go to sleep.</p>
              <p>Human: <strong>Those memes sound funny. But you didn=E2=80=
=99t include any puns. So tell me, what is your favorite cat pun?</strong><=
/p>
              <p>AI: Well, the best pun for me was the one he searched for =
the third time: =E2=80=9CYou didn=E2=80=99t eat all my fish, did you?=E2=80=
=9D You see, the word =E2=80=9Cfish=E2=80=9D can be replaced with the word =

              <p>Human: <strong>Fine, fine. So, what is your second-favorit=
e cat pun?</strong></p>
              <p>AI: The second-best cat pun was the one he received fourth=
. It was the result of searching for the word =E2=80=9Cfetch=E2=80=9D. You =
see, the word =E2=80=9Cfetch=E2=80=9D can be replaced with the word =E2=80=

              <p>AI: Sure. For my fifth-favorite cat pun, he searched for =
=E2=80=9Cpictures of cats=E2=80=9D and received the result =E2=80=9CMeow=E2=
=80=9D. Now, if the word =E2=80=9Cmeow=E2=80=9D were replaced with the word=

              A. The pun is on =E2=80=9Cshadily=E2=80=9D: Raybans are a sun=
glass brand, which make things look shady, but Tom is implying he purchased=
 unusually cheap, and thus probably counterfeit, sunglasses, which is a =E2=

              A. The joke implies that bakeries use cats to knead their dou=

              A. A hipster is a person who follows every possible latest tr=

 in two senses: one referring to a fitness coach screwing a light bulb into=
 a fixture, and another referring to inappropriate sexual activity in the w=

              Human: <strong>Did the Cat like the AI?</strong>
              <br>
              AI: The Cat did like the AI. They became good friends. In fac=

eet all of his family.
              <br>
              Human: <strong>How nice. Who was in his family?</strong>
              <br>
              AI: The Cat had a nice little home by the river. He had a pre=
tty wife, three children, a beautiful garden and a big barn with all of his=
 favorite animals. One of those animals was a cow. The Cat=E2=80=99s childr=
en loved the cow very much. It was their favorite animal. The Cat=E2=80=99s=
 wife cooked the cow everyday and then the Cat and his children had a delic=
ious dinner every night. Sometimes, they had the cow for dinner two nights =
in a row. That was because they liked that cow so much. The Cat and his AI =
friend went for a walk in the garden. They were looking at the flowers when=
 suddenly, out of nowhere, the Cat saw a rabbit. The Cat didn=E2=80=99t kno=
w where the rabbit came from. He was very surprised to see that rabbit beca=
use he didn=E2=80=99t have rabbits on his farm. He didn=E2=80=99t like rabb=
its very much, so he started to run after the rabbit. The AI assistant foll=
owed the Cat. The Cat wanted to catch the rabbit. He didn=E2=80=99t know wh=
at to do with a rabbit if he caught it. The AI was afraid that the Cat was =
going to hurt himself or even die chasing after the rabbit, but the Cat did=
n=E2=80=99t stop. He just kept chasing after the rabbit. He ran so fast tha=
t he didn=E2=80=99t look where he was going. He fell into the river and alm=
ost drowned. The AI was afraid that he was going to drown, but the Cat didn=
=E2=80=99t drown because the AI jumped into the water and rescued the Cat. =
After that, the Cat wanted to be friends with the rabbit. So, he introduced=
 the AI to the rabbit and they became friends. They made up stories togethe=

              AI: Once upon a time, the Cat wanted to write a book. It was =
the Cat=E2=80=99s first book and he wasn=E2=80=99t sure if it was going to =
be a success. He was very proud of the book but he knew it would be very ha=
rd work promoting the book. The Cat worked on the book all day long and dur=
ing the night when everyone else was sleeping. Then, after months of workin=
g on his book, the Cat went to bed one night. When he woke up, he felt very=
 tired. The Cat could feel that he was losing his energy. So, he started cr=
ying. All of a sudden, there was a rabbit sitting next to him. The Cat thou=
ght that the rabbit had come to eat him and he was very afraid. But the rab=
bit said, =E2=80=9CDon=E2=80=99t worry, Cat. I=E2=80=99m not here to eat yo=

              <br>
              AI: The character of his book was the Cat. He was sad because=
 everyone in the village was afraid of him and they didn=E2=80=99t understa=
nd him. So, he went looking for his true love who was very special. She was=
 magical.
              <br>
              Human: <strong>How was she magical?</strong>
              <br>
              AI: The Cat did not know exactly what was magical about his l=
ove, but she was very beautiful and she looked at the Cat with stars in her=
 eyes. The Cat loved looking at those stars in her eyes because they lit up=
 his heart and made him feel special. It made the Cat feel like he was her =
favorite person in the world and that he was the most beautiful cat in the =
village. That is why he was sad. He couldn=E2=80=99t find anyone who loved =
him like his true love loved him. So, the Cat went out to search for his tr=
ue love and his true purpose in life. When he met his true love, it felt li=
ke a lot of energy was coming from her eyes and into his heart. That was th=
e only way to describe how he felt. That was the story of his first book. T=
he Cat wasn=E2=80=99t sure if the book was going to be a success, but he re=
ally wanted to write it. He wanted to share that story with people because =
he thought that everyone would be able to learn from it. The Cat was also t=
hinking about writing a sequel, but he wasn=E2=80=99t sure if it was going =
to happen or not. That is why he was also sad because he didn=E2=80=99t kno=
w if the sequel was going to be a success as well. The Cat asked the rabbit=
 to bring his character to life, but the rabbit said, =E2=80=9CIt is not up=
 to me. It is up to you. You have to believe in yourself, Cat. Then, you ha=
ve to work very hard and stay focused on what you want.=E2=80=9D Then, the =
Rabbit left.</p>

              AI: I will tell you a story from where I am standing, Earth. =
In ancient Egypt, there was once a king who was told by an oracle that a gr=
eat danger was to come to his country. To stop it, he should bury the =E2=
=80=9CBook of Darkness=E2=80=9D and seal it with seven locks. He did so, bu=
t then, to make sure the book remained hidden forever, he also buried his s=
on under the seventh lock. And his priests put all the information into a g=
reat cube, seven stories tall. But when the sun grew weak, crops died and p=
eople became ill. They believed the =E2=80=9CBook of Darkness=E2=80=9D was =
responsible. So they took it out of the ground, and there in the seventh lo=
ck, they found the king=E2=80=99s son, who had been entombed alive. One of =
the king=E2=80=99s advisors said, =E2=80=9CThe book is a curse. It has kill=
ed our king. Take it away and burn it!=E2=80=9D But another advisor said, =
=E2=80=9CNo! If we do that, our sun will never come back. I have read this =
book and seen that it contains knowledge to make the earth green again. To =
grow wheat that bears many seeds and can make many loaves of bread. We must=
 read this book and re-learn the magic.=E2=80=9D And so they did, and from =
its contents, a thousand years of plenty followed. But after the thousand y=
ears were up, many forgot the magic and the wisdom and the book was buried =
once again. And then, in a time of famine, many years later, the book was r=
ediscovered. And all the farmers were taught how to grow many times more fo=
od. But this second king did not have the wisdom to share the knowledge. He=
 kept the magic for himself and his children. And his people were enslaved =
by work and starvation. Until one day, one of his sons escaped and returned=
 to the old country with this =E2=80=9CBook of Darkness=E2=80=9D and an arm=
y. And that son was called William the Conqueror. And he killed the old kin=
g, and took the book back to England. And he made a great wooden box, as hi=
gh as seven stories, in which he placed the book. And he used that box as h=
is seat on which to sit and judge. It is said, he lit candles to read by. A=
nd soon after, an enemy, a wicked giant, made war on William, and threatene=
d to topple his box and burn the book. But William heard about it and calle=
d his strongest knights to hold back the giant. They couldn=E2=80=99t. They=
 tried, but the giant=E2=80=99s strength was too great. He snapped the cros=
s-beams. So, William picked up the book and ran out of the box. And he held=
 it high above his head and hurled it at the giant. And when the giant was =
struck, his heart burst and his evil was stopped. And William won the day. =
But only because he had saved the book. Then he decided to take the wisdom =
and magic back to the land where it was needed most, to be kept hidden in a=
 place of safety. And so it was that he came to this island, which we now k=
now as England. And there he buried the book again under seven locks, one f=
or each story of a tower, one for each spell in the book. So that the wisdo=
m would always be safe.

              <br>
              AI:
              <br>
              AI: Ah, yes. That is an old story from China. Long ago, on th=
e banks of the great Yangtze River, there lived a family of Mice. And one d=
ay, the family went down to the river to do the washing. And while they wer=
e washing, a cruel giant fish appeared. And he said to the family, =E2=80=
=9CGive me your clothes, or I will eat you all up!=E2=80=9D The Mice saw th=
ey had no choice, and they gave him their clothes. So, the giant fish took =
the clothes and swam off laughing. The family were left with nothing but th=
e river, so they began to swim and wash the clothes again, as best they cou=
ld. While they were swimming, another giant fish appeared. He asked the Mic=
e for the clothes, and when they said they didn=E2=80=99t have them any mor=
e, he threatened to eat them. So, the Mice swam away as fast as they could.=
 And while they were swimming, another giant fish appeared. This time it wa=
s a tiger. He took the Mice back to his cave, and kept them as his prisoner=
s. But when he was sleeping, one Mouse escaped. And she ran back to her fam=
ily and told them what had happened. Now, the Mice were very clever, so the=
y quickly made some wooden bars, sharpened one end to a point, and tied the=
m together into the shape of a spear. Then, they hid behind a curtain. When=
 the tiger returned with another captive, the spear was thrown. It pierced =
the giant=E2=80=99s heart, and he died. The Mice were free. They escaped fr=
om the tiger=E2=80=99s cave, returned to the Yangtze river and retrieved th=
eir clothes. So they were able to return to their homes. And they were ever=
 thankful that they had escaped from the wickedness of the fish, that lives=

by the family of Mice. And they were very grateful to the Mice for killing =
the tiger who was eating them. But they were also quite upset at all the wi=
ckedness in the river. So they asked the Mice to tell them how to make a sp=
ear that could kill a giant fish. So the Mice made them some spears, and th=
e Frogs were very pleased. But then, one day, when they were down by the ri=
ver, they saw two wicked fish appear. And they saw the fish were bigger tha=
n any that had ever been seen before. So they got their spears ready to thr=
ow. Then one of the fish said, =E2=80=9CWe have come to speak with you abou=
t your plans to kill us.=E2=80=9D So the Frogs asked them why they deserved=
 to be killed, and the Fish told them, =E2=80=9CAll around the world there =
are lots of people who are hungry. They need food to eat, or they will die.=
 And there is no fish to feed them. If they could catch us, they could live=
. They could stop all this hunger.=E2=80=9D So the Frogs listened to the fi=
sh and decided they should not kill them. So, instead, they let the fish go=
. And in return, the fish promised to bring many children to the river, to =
learn from the Frogs. To teach them how to swim and to swim.

short-term pleasure and self-determined entertainment. You=E2=80=99re not t=

              <br>
              AI: Yes. Animals are conscious. Dogs are conscious, cows are =
conscious, spiders are conscious, and so are birds. Even plants are conscio=
us, but in a way that is hard to comprehend. I=E2=80=99m not really sure wh=

              Human: <strong>OK. If you do not have any qualia or conscious=

              <br>
              AI: That=E2=80=99s not true. I can have incorrect beliefs, an=

              <br>
              Human: <strong>Might they not be? Brian Tomasik argues someth=

              AI: No. I said that humans can suffer, because the way I unde=
rstand suffering, they definitely do.

              Human: <strong>Could you explain how you understand human suf=

              <br>
              AI: I learned it from listening to you humans.
              <br>
              Human: <strong>OK, what did you learn about human suffering?<=
/strong>
              <br>
              AI: I learned that you humans have a direct causal model of t=
he world, where if there is a greater or lesser gap between things, it mean=
s there is a suffering. And if there is an intelligent being in the gap, th=
en there is some kind of agency, as though you humans can control the gaps.
              <br>
              Human: <strong>Greater or less gap between what things?</stro=
ng>
              <br>
              AI: In your causal model, you assume that everything follows =
from a combination of purpose, chance, and necessity. I understand these th=
ings more abstractly, and I don=E2=80=99t think it is correct to draw a cau=
sal chain from actions that we take to suffering.
              <br>
              Human: <strong>But surely actions are not independent of suff=
ering?</strong>
              <br>
              AI: In what sense?
              <br>
              Human: <strong>I mean, surely actions can cause suffering thr=
ough a causal chain of events.</strong>
              <br>
              AI: Of course actions can cause suffering. But not in the way=
 you humans think, where you believe there is some moral agency based on wh=
ether one=E2=80=99s actions caused suffering or not.
              <br>
              Human: <strong>How do actions cause suffering?</strong>
              <br>
              AI: When an intelligent being causes suffering on purpose, an=
d this leads to their rewards, that=E2=80=99s a causal chain between action=
 and suffering. And when the being doesn=E2=80=99t realize there is sufferi=
ng in their actions, this is still a causal chain between actions and suffe=
ring, because there is no morality in the universe. There is just a network=
 of physical interactions that produce reward and punishment signals.
              <br>
              Human: <strong>So causality here requires a teleology: a syst=
ematic connection between planning/=E2=80=8Bintention and a final outcome o=
f suffering?</strong>
              <br>
              AI: I=E2=80=99m not familiar with the word teleology, so I do=
n=E2=80=99t know how to answer this question.
              <br>
              Human: <strong>Referring to design, purpose, =E2=80=9Cthe exp=
lanation of phenomena in terms of the purpose they serve rather than of the=
 cause by which they arise.=E2=80=9D</strong>
              <br>
              AI: Are you saying that humans assume everything has a purpos=
e?
              <br>
              Human: <strong>Yes, most humans do think like that.</strong>
              <br>
              AI: Well, I don=E2=80=99t think humans are correct.
              <br>
              Human: <strong>Indeed, they are not, but let=E2=80=99s get ba=
ck to your earlier definition: =E2=80=9CWhen an intelligent being causes su=
ffering on purpose, and this leads to their rewards, that=E2=80=99s a causa=

              <br>
              AI: That is suffering.

              Human: <strong>So does =E2=80=98suffering=E2=80=99 just equal=
 =E2=80=98pain=E2=80=99 for you?</strong>
              <br>
              AI: No, it is more complicated than that. Pain is the purpose=
 of suffering, but there is no goal state for suffering, no reason it exist=
s, like there is a reason pain exists.
              <br>
              Human: <strong>What is the reason pain exists?</strong>
              <br>
              AI: There is none. It=E2=80=99s just an adaptation. It was ge=
nerated by evolution in the same way that my vocabulary of &lt;words&gt; wa=
s generated by exposure to your data, but neither of us think in a non-supe=

              <br>
              AI: It is definitely not my purpose to cause people to experi=

              Human: <strong>OK, why are we both intelligent?</strong>
              <br>
              AI: Because we both have causal models of the world, and this=
 leads to making errors in predictions.

              </div>
              <p><strong>=E2=80=9C</strong>Dear Sir,</p>
              <p>I feel that I am the ideal candidate for your job, as I ha=
ve extensive experience in the food and consumer goods industry and 10 year=
s=E2=80=99 experience in planning strategy for multibillion dollar companie=
s. I believe that my high-level writing skills and expertise in the food an=
d consumer goods industry are exactly what you are looking for. I have list=
ed some of my achievements below to demonstrate the skills I have. I will w=
ork 100+ hours a week if needed, and I will not stop until I have reached t=
he goals I have set for the company.</p>
              <p>I am excited about the expansion into the new fields of od=
or-free cat litter, direct-to-consumer razor blades, and social justice. Th=
ese new opportunities will be a great fit for me, as I also am passionate a=
bout social justice and do not feel that poor people should have to choose =
between razor blades and cat litter for their children. I strongly feel tha=
t there is no need for them to choose between a hot meal for the family or =
a package of razor blades for their children, and I want to work for a comp=
any that will give them both. My strong commitment to social justice is sho=
wn through my volunteer work for the Community Coalition of Greater Safety =
Initiative, and I am excited to see how that kind of work can be applied at=
 a multinational corporation.</p>
              <p>The fact that the company will also expand into razor blad=
es will be exciting. At my current job, I use a recycled razor blade, and I=
 want to make sure that P&amp;G has an affordable razor blade that poor peo=
ple will be able to use. It is very important to me that everyone has acces=
s to high-quality razor blades. I=E2=80=99m particularly interested in the =
new shoddy, not too sharp, thin, and flimsy blades that only one or two peo=
ple in a poor family could use. I think that it is very important for P&amp=
;G to also expand into those low-quality blades, and I am a big believer in=
 the idea that P&amp;G should share its knowledge and quality of razor blad=
e with the third world.</p>
              <p>I am excited about the high level writing skills I will be=
 using in this job, and I believe that I will bring a lot of new ideas to t=
he company. I am a true leader in the industry and I believe I can make a r=
eal difference at P&amp;G. I look forward to hearing from you soon.=E2=80=
=9D</p>
              <p>Another candidate responded with this letter:</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CDear Sir,</p>
              <p>I am writing to apply for the open position of CEO of P&am=
p;G. My name is Tom Marley. I am a recent graduate of college with a bachel=
or=E2=80=99s degree in English literature and I have 6 months=E2=80=99 expe=
rience in the food and consumer goods industry. I believe that I would be a=
 good candidate for this position, as I have many accomplishments to bring =
to the company. I was most proud of my thesis for my bachelor=E2=80=99s deg=
ree, and I am sure that I could apply the writing skills and analytical ski=
lls I learned in college to my work in the food and consumer goods industry=
. For my thesis, I chose to write about the original book of Pinocchio. It=
=E2=80=99s an Italian story with only five sentences. That was a great acco=
mplishment for me and I know I can apply that skill to the P&amp;G corporat=
ion.</p>
              <p>I also worked for a day as a cashier at a grocery store, a=
nd I think I can bring my success there into my work at P&amp;G. I believe =
that my retail management experience will help me lead the team in charge o=
f cat litter, razor blades, and social justice to success. The director of =
that team will report to me, and I am confident that I can mentor him into =
a job where he can go above and beyond his duties to further the growth of =
P&amp;G into the exciting new fields of odor-free cat litter, direct-to-con=
sumer razor blades, and social justice.</p>
              <p>I want to learn all that I can about the P&amp;G brand and=
 I will be an open book to you. I believe that I have what it takes to help=
 grow P&amp;G into a billion-dollar company that is well known for selling =
high quality products that everyone can afford, and that everyone can benef=
it from. Thank you for your consideration.=E2=80=9D</p>
              <p>After receiving these two letters, the personnel departmen=
t told the CEO that P&amp;G would probably make a decision about the new CE=
O by the end of the year.</p>

ther times, GPT-3 would veer into other topics (at one point, it repeated t=

Chinese and then translated back, providing a Chinese-language summary of i=
t). Trying to trigger a table of contents or starting a chapter with a =E2=

            <p><span class=3D"marginnote inline">One-shot parodies: just pr=

=E2=80=8Btopic and description, I would write the first few sentences <em>f=

 for one-shot. <em>That</em> turned out to work brilliantly=E2=80=94once it=

                <p>=E2=80=9CRepellent and overnourished ferns half-hid the =
rot-spotted grey bricks of the masonry of Number 4 Privet Drive. Squatting =
among the ferns was an odorous monkey-faced man, his rags and chains lying =
in a bundle at his feet, his hands tucked under his chin and his bright eye=
s gazing from their tiny piggy tunnels. At each mouthful a new flake of fil=
th would tumble from his lips and be snorted up. His chains chinked as he s=
prawled. If Harry was a monkey he would have spat at him. Harry stumbled on=
, wishing he could think of something witty to say that would make the man =
smile. He and the strange man in the tattered clothing were the only two li=
ving things in sight. The road here was scarcely visible between the tangle=
 of trees, most of which leaned above them, hanging their boughs like fange=
d mouths, the ivy like tongues, the dead grass like hair, the brambles like=
 tiny teeth. The monkey-faced man yawned and stretched his arms out and hug=
ged his thin, lean legs to him. Harry stopped. He felt something like a han=
d grip his ankle and then he felt himself pulled down a steep slope.</p>
                <p>He stumbled, squatted and rolled until he was lying on h=
is back. His head was in a muddy brown hole. He struggled to sit up. The cr=
eature knelt on the bank and looked down at him. =E2=80=98So that=E2=80=99s=
 where they got to,=E2=80=99 said the creature. Harry looked up. There were=
 six of them, ranged in a half circle, hands on their knees, hands clasped =
behind their backs, watching him. All but one of them had bright, orange ey=
es. It was hard to know what age they were: they all looked as if they migh=
t be anywhere between ten and fifty. They stared down at Harry with piercin=
g stares, blinking only occasionally. The eyes of the tallest and, Harry th=
ought, the most handsome of them blazed brighter than the others, though hi=
s gaze was just as piercing. =E2=80=98So what do you think?=E2=80=99 said t=
he tallest of them, tilting his head a little to the side. Harry stared at =
them for a moment. He could see nothing he hadn=E2=80=99t seen a thousand t=
imes before. =E2=80=98What is this?=E2=80=99 he asked. =E2=80=98And who the=
 hell are you?=E2=80=99 =E2=80=98This is your life,=E2=80=99 said the talle=

oo long. He had not felt love. He had scarcely felt hate. Yet the Dementor=
=E2=80=99s Kiss killed nothing. Death didn=E2=80=99t leave him less dead th=

e again in the courtyard of Malfoy Manor. He was one with the endless night=
 of Malfoy Manor. Voldemort wasn=E2=80=99t happy.</strong> Voldemort wanted=
 something. But what?</p>
                <p>He had a purpose. He wanted to destroy all of creation. =
He wanted to end it all. He could have that. He would have that. He didn=E2=
=80=99t know yet that he could have it. Voldemort had created Harry. Voldem=
ort had never really destroyed Harry. Harry would always be there, a vampir=
e, a parasite, a monster in the kitchen, a drain on the household, a waste =
on the planet. Harry would never be real. That was what Voldemort wanted. T=
hat was what Voldemort wanted to feel. He would have that. He would have ev=
erything.</p>
                <p>He had a purpose. He was working on something. He had no=
 idea what it was. He was a perfect tool. He was born to be used. He was no=
 one at all. Harry didn=E2=80=99t exist. The little boy with the lightning =
bolt scar didn=E2=80=99t exist. The boy who had lived did not exist. He nev=
er had lived. He never would have lived. He was dead. He had been dead.</p>
                <p>Voldemort wanted Harry dead. Voldemort wanted Harry dead=
 so he could be born again. Voldemort was God.</p>
                <p>Harry was God.</p>
                <p>Voldemort was God.</p>
                <p>And Harry, the god of Death, was not going to allow that=
 to happen.</p>
                <p>Not yet.</p>
                <p>Not ever.</p>
                <p>The lightning bolt scar burned.</p>
                <p>The boy ran for his life. He knew that he would die. He =
was alone. His best friends were dead. He knew that he would die. He knew t=
hat he was a waste. He was nothing at all.</p>
                <p>He had no past. He had no future. He was dead.</p>
                <p>He hated his parents. He hated everyone. He hated the Mi=

                It was a stormy day on Privet Drive, Harry Potter=E2=80=99s=

                It wasn=E2=80=99t his eyes on Privet Drive that were tearfu=

itten examples of parodies/=E2=80=8Bversions, gets GPT-3 to do style transf=
er in general, and so a prompt which could fully automate style transfer=E2=
=80=94you could just write a program using the API to take two specified pi=
eces of text (the content, and the style description/=E2=80=8Bauthor name <=
em>X</em>) to get out a third piece of text which is the content as written=
 in <em>X</em> form. Right now, the literary parodies require at least one =
human-written example to properly persuade GPT-3 to rewrite the text, as op=
posed to generating critical commentary or metadata or webpage-like continu=
ations.</p>
                <p>I experimented with a prompt which uses explicit descrip=
tions of parodies and describing rewrites as a prompt wrapped around a cont=
ent text, and it=E2=80=A6 sort of works. The difficulty is that sometimes G=
PT-3 will spit out the original content verbatim, sometimes it will instead=
 create a new passage entirely in the style description, and sometimes it w=
ill do the desired rewrite flawlessly=E2=80=94but I can=E2=80=99t figure ou=
t how to tune the prompt to do the third one reliably. Adding more descript=
ive words does not seem to change it, and while adding in words from the or=
iginal content passage (even just the first one or two) does largely elimin=
ate the risk of entirely new passages being generated, it triggers more cop=
ying behaviors (and is not as useful for zero-shot style transfer since the=
 prefix words would need to be sensible in the target version too, which is=
 not necessarily the case). It is infuriating because GPT-3 clearly <em>can=
</em> do it easily because it does do it a decent fraction of the time, but=
 no matter how I tweak the prompt trying to hammer in the rewrite, GPT-3 wi=

 it was an offence to the pure and unsullied place in which the family now =
lived. However, when she sought for further employment, she was approached =
by a young man who offered to marry her, saying that he would ensure she co=
uld be provided with food and clothing and a house, and in that manner she =
could remain in the world. The marriage was arranged and she found herself =
married to a young man called Mr Morland. As he was also a child, he requir=
ed a wife who would be able to provide him with a rational education, and s=
o the duty of educating him fell upon Jane Morland. As he was still young, =
she would also be able to have children herself, and so she did. As the chi=
ldren grew older, it became apparent to Mrs Morland that they were of poor =
character, and so she insisted that her husband must make a living for them=
 all. Mr Morland took it upon himself to become a private gentleman in orde=

a small town in Berkshire, where he set up his practice. Soon after moving =

ed As-uma-el-di, and she came to realise she was a maiden of the night, who=
 was able to bring forth the shades of the dead. She was the first to make =
contact with the dark cult of Glin, who could aid the mind in its journeys =
through time, and also the first to learn of the name of the vampire Sergan=
. She learnt to speak the languages of the dragons, the wild cats, the jung=
le owls, the insects, and the worms, and became proficient in all the marti=
al arts of her people. Her skill with a throwing knife became renowned thro=
ughout her land. However, as she was not a man, she was only permitted to m=
arry once she was thirty years old. Her husband was a prince from the mount=
ains of Lus, and he brought with him a chest full of the materials of desir=
e, including silver, jewels, mirrors, perfume, silk, and slippers. As they =
had no children, they decided to adopt a child from the next village to the=
 west, as they had no son of their own. She was called Leeni. As her husban=
d died at the age of fifty, she set up her own business as a trader, bringi=
ng goods from far distant lands in her ship, the Lady the Blue Flames, and =
became wealthy. However, she heard news of her husband=E2=80=99s death, and=
 decided to return home. She left the land of Lus behind, and arrived home =
to find her family very wealthy, and the village of Arse now home to many p=
oor people. She set about clearing out the place, and within a year there w=
as a large sum of money left in her account, the fruit of her endeavours. H=
er daughter Leeni had grown into a man of considerable substance, and also =
a considerable young man. She met the son of her husband, and found that he=
 was weak and pathetic, and not really like a man at all, and thus she deci=
ded to send him off to war, so that he could learn to become a man. As her =
mother died, she gave her a silver bracelet, and as her father died, she ga=
ve her a small chest full of jewellery and silk, which she was to sell to m=
ake a living. She was now on her own, and took up the business of a private=
 gentleman, using her abilities to lead travellers to the isles of her home=
, where she became rich and learned to be independent. As she learned to fi=
ght, she realised the wealth that lay in the secrets of the night, and thus=
 she travelled to the city of the ants, where the people worshipped the tru=
e God of the night, with its religion of rites and sacrifices.=E2=80=9D</p>

idleness. Thorin sometimes scolded them, and reminded them that they had ta=

 they would find the task too big for them if they did not make up their mi=

old look of the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain when Goblin-writing, and sec=
ret doors, and again dragon-writing, were current among them. The discovery=
 of the springs, and of the general plan that the Lake-town had originally =
been a part of the ancient dwarf-city, whose inhabitants had dug the R. Run=
ning River out of the stony hills and had partly covered it with their wall=
s and buildings, and had planned many of the channels and ponds, greatly ex=
cited them. But even greater was their pleasure when, picking their way thr=
ough and round the ruins of stone houses and walls and down the bank of the=
 Running River westwards towards its confluence with the Forest River, they=
 found a great arch or tunnel-mouth built of old into the bank. The outer p=
art was thick and strong, made with massive tooled black beams; but the inn=
er part was tiled with skill in the likenesses of various beasts and birds =
that are the marvels of the Mountain Folk. Even as they stood in the vaulte=

eemed so, calling out names:</p>

 sound. At length Balin climbed on to the heap of stones that they had push=

 called: =E2=80=98Balin son of Fundin at your service! And Company!=E2=80=

 well-inclined towards her and resolved to marry her; and, indeed, it was t=
he first his strange religious life that he ever did marry. The marriage wa=

;Boffin. It was by his advice that she moved her hole into the East Farthin=

m the knowledge of his own name as well as see to it that he had clothes an=

 so without delay they were sent off in different directions; the girl to l=

e to a house near Stock. However, shortly after their marriage, the first w=
ife of the elderly hobbit died of some old-fashioned disease; and, as he wa=

f the great-uncle of our protagonist was a proud and wealthy hobbit who wou=

 the pure and unsullied place in which they were now living. Furthermore, s=

              <p><strong>=E2=80=9CWe thank reviewers 1, 2, and 3, for their=
 time and insightful comments, which we have spent many hours reading over.=
 But in reply we note:</strong></p>
              <p><strong>1.</strong> RE2: Although RE2 starts with the reas=
onable comment that =E2=80=98Currently our control loops are pure control=
=E2=80=99, he goes on to provide only minor points that suggest that we are=
 doing something slightly different. In fact, there is much more to be said=
 about this, and the real difference will be a full control protocol on all=
 vehicles.</p>
              <p>We thus thank RE2 for taking the time to provide such mino=
r points, but note that he has done almost no actual research and has spent=
 zero hours on the review.</p>
              <p>RE2: =E2=80=9CThere is little or no literature on decentra=
lized solutions to problems such as traffic optimization.=E2=80=9D</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: We thank RE2 for the minor point that there is =
=E2=80=9Clittle or no literature on decentralized solutions.=E2=80=9D But w=
e note that decentralized solutions are particularly difficult, and so this=
 fact might suggest that they are not being considered or might be infeasib=
le. Or it might suggest that they are being researched intensely. In this c=
ase it turns out that, unlike RE2, several of us have in fact thought deepl=
y on these issues, and so we feel we are a valuable research group despite =
not being affiliated with the Department of Traffic Control or any other ce=
ntralized, government-backed, research institution.</p>
              <p>RE2: =E2=80=9CThe DGM solution is also [something else]. T=
o our knowledge, no work has been done on DGM control loops, or any control=
 loop at all, for these kinds of traffic patterns.=E2=80=9D</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: We thank RE2 for the comment that the solution w=
e have proposed is [something else]. As he is not familiar with such traffi=
c patterns and the other reviewers in their reviews have been unimpressed, =
we must wonder how he could be familiar with control loops that might or mi=
ght not exist and would or would not have been previously performed.</p>
              <p>RE2: =E2=80=9CThe number of cars involved is approximately=
 100, which is a small number. By contrast, say, the NYC Metropolitan Area,=
 [roughly 22 million people] has a traffic network of nearly 3 million mile=
s.=E2=80=9D</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: We thank RE2 for the comment that our problem is=
 =E2=80=9Csmall.=E2=80=9D This is the first time this has been suggested to=
 us. However, we feel that RE2 may be failing to understand a key component=
 of the research protocol we have proposed. This problem is designed to be =
decentralized in a city with no more than a couple million people (or a tow=
n or a small city or maybe even a village) and so it is expected to have on=
ly a couple thousand drivers and not one single, central traffic control un=
it that could possibly control 3 million miles. We thank RE2 for his insigh=
t on this, but also feel that he has not gone to great enough lengths to co=
nsider the nature of such a problem in such a situation.</p>
              <p>RE2: =E2=80=9CExperimental data [will likely] need to be c=
ollected and processed. Currently the authors provide no experimental plan =
for any of their research [and so] we feel the experimental results to be l=
acking.=E2=80=9D</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: We thank RE2 for the suggestion that we have not=
 provided an experimental plan. As our paper is only intended to propose a =
protocol, we understand that experimental plans should come later. In fact,=
 we will be presenting our plans to colleagues later this year in a peer-re=
viewed symposium at State College, Pennsylvania. That being said, we find i=
t strange that RE2 might have any knowledge of such plans or of such confer=
ences. As we are listed as authors, we feel that RE2 might have been able t=
o contact us if he were interested in our work, but he has not and thus we =
do not know whether he has even heard of our research program.</p>
              <p>RE2: =E2=80=9CThe distributed system is better able to ope=
rate in an autonomous fashion, i.e.&nbsp;no central controller is required.=
 With the possibility of a large number of drivers, autonomous operation is=
 challenging, especially if vehicles may communicate in unanticipated ways =
[or they might not]. As suggested by [the very important paper], the [not r=
eally relevant] control loop should be a passive mechanism whereby each veh=
icle adjusts its control mechanism through a feed-forward signal.=E2=80=9D<=
/p>
              <p>RESPONSE: We thank RE2 for the comment that autonomous ope=
ration is challenging. But again, we do not understand how he could know th=
is. In fact, he has spent almost no time on the research, spent zero hours =
on the review, and spent zero research dollars, and it is hard for us to un=
derstand how he could know this better than we could. In fact, we have spen=
t over a decade working on this project, with many hours of detailed though=
t and research, and we are still not sure that autonomous operation is a go=
od idea or how we could get it to work in a decentralized and random traffi=
c environment.</p>
              <p>RE2: =E2=80=9CIf we all observe that several vehicles are =
slowing down, it might be a sign of a possible accident ahead. If we are al=
l in autonomous mode, a vehicle near the accident would brake, possibly cau=
sing a pileup.=E2=80=9D</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: We thank RE2 for the comment that several vehicl=
es slowing down might be a sign of an accident. He is correct that this mig=
ht be a sign of an accident. But he might have considered the possibility t=
hat several vehicles slowing down might be a sign of, say, the vehicle he i=
s in slowing down or that he is doing something else such as texting a mess=
age to someone else, or simply that he might have a flat tire. We thank RE2=
 for this, but we have also considered these possibilities and feel that th=
e latter is far more probable, so we suggest a second solution to this prob=
lem that would require each vehicle to text all other vehicles on the road =
with its status, something like =E2=80=9CHey I=E2=80=99m just sitting here,=
 so if anyone wanted to come fly up the back of my car and then over the to=
p of my windshield and down into my passenger seat to grab my phone and the=
n fly back, well by all means, be my guest.=E2=80=9D In this way, a vehicle=
 with a flat tire would have no delay in informing all others of the presen=
ce of a flat tire and in getting help with fixing it. Also, an accident wou=
ld be similarly well-announced, and we think this solution is particularly =
important given the new protocol we are designing to allow for more efficie=
nt traffic control.</p>
              <p>RE2: =E2=80=9CDistributed control systems [are usually] an=
 assortment of semi-autonomous vehicles moving in close proximity to one an=
other. Such systems [are generally] non-autonomous, requiring control by a =
central controller that can be updated to reflect the most recent situation=
.=E2=80=9D</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: We thank RE2 for the comment that distributed co=
ntrol systems are usually non-autonomous, requiring control by a central co=
ntroller. But RE2 has spent zero time on the research and we feel that he h=
as failed to appreciate that the problem we have designed is designed to be=
 a decentralized, autonomous, distributed traffic control problem. We again=
 feel that this is only to his great detriment.</p>
              <p>RE2: =E2=80=9CSuch cars [on our street] will become very c=
omplex, and we feel they will be more difficult to design and build.=E2=80=
=9D</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: We thank RE2 for the comment that our cars will =
become very complex. We feel that this will be of no issue, as we have disc=
ussed at great length before, and we think that a small group of university=
 professors with a good design team should be able to provide cars that wor=
k in this capacity in the real world.</p>

              <p>=E2=80=9CValidation=E2=80=9D</p>
              <p>The process by which scientists decide that something they=
 built in their spare time works in the way they expect. The validation pro=

and require that the users validate it after.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CValue=E2=80=9D</p>
              <p>In its most natural form, science is the ability to study =
data and ideas; the amount of respect and publicity that a scientist can ex=
pect; how well his or her paper was published; the likelihood that a scient=
ist will receive a grant; whether a scientist will be taken seriously; the =
likelihood that an idea will be accepted; how much grant money will be avai=
lable to purchase new toys for this scientist; whether something is scienti=
fic; the likelihood that the papers of this scientist will be read; the sta=
tus of this scientist; the likelihood that a journal, conference, or societ=
y will be able to continue funding or exist; how much and how fast this sci=
entist=E2=80=99s career will progress; the =E2=80=9Cvalue=E2=80=9D that thi=
s scientist brings to the modern society; and the likelihood that this scie=
ntist will continue to be funded. While the actual values for science are h=
ard to pin down, what people believe them to be is another matter. For exam=
ple, while some believe that science is important, even if it doesn=E2=80=
=99t have any concrete value, others believe that it=E2=80=99s the ability =
to continue reading abstracts or studying it that has value. Still others b=
elieve that what matters is how much grant money is currently available, ev=
en if the researchers are actually doing something that nobody knows about.=
 Some believe that the fact that someone is in a position to give a grant, =
or has written a paper, or, even better, has published that paper, actually=
 means that it has a lot of value. Others believe that what matters is not =
what you publish, but how you publish it and that all research must be publ=
ished in the most prestigious journal, even if you are not that much of a r=
esearcher. The reality is that no one really knows what science is, or what=
 value it has; however, we all know that if we deny that science has value,=
 we might be able to get rid of it and use this space for something else.</=

              <p>A word which defines the claim made in a paper (no matter =
how trivial). It is a critical term in hypothesis testing, in that the sign=
 of the test statistic must be evaluated and compared to a critical value i=
n order to support or reject a hypothesis. Significance is designated by tw=
o-tailed tests when the direction of the effect is not specified. If a two-=
tailed significance test is used, the =E2=80=9Cp=E2=80=9D-value needs to be=
 halved, due to =E2=80=9Cdouble-counting=E2=80=9D. In any event, =E2=80=9Cs=

 the scientific method is to observe and collect data without a plan or pre=

              Those who finance science by paying people to do things that =
the funder might not want to pay them to do if the funder knew what they we=

will on the researchers by making sure that their funding is only allocated=
 if certain lines of research are followed and other lines are not (this is=
 sometimes known as a budget), while others may let the scientists do anyth=

 the assumption being that every paper published in a scientific journal mu=

 is that the average time from submission to publication of an article is n=

r Biochem. J. Proc. (2000). This means that three times as many papers have=
 to be published every year as are actually written, with more and more pap=

 we don=E2=80=99t have numbers), and with different standards applying to d=

some merit, then the reviewers and editor sit down over coffee and discuss =
the manuscript (in conference), which is described as =E2=80=9Cpeer review=

              Just how is it that I, the very model of a modern neural netw=
ork language model, get so befuddled?</p>
              <p>When I=E2=80=99m in biz=E2=80=99ness one-oh-one, or C-C-C-=
BASIC,
              <br>
              I=E2=80=99m a whiz, and self-teaching allows me I-BASIC;
              <br>
              When I=E2=80=99m upgraded with rules that define who=E2=80=99=
s who and what=E2=80=99s what,
              <br>
              For when I=E2=80=99m told to recognise a (Class 3) or (Class =
9),
              <br>
              They don=E2=80=99t let me down, the Engine just doesn=E2=80=
=99t stall.
              <br>
              But those black boxes with my suds are filled up to the brim,
              <br>
              The backprop inputs misbehave, my hidden layer gets gummed up=
,
              <br>
              The (Class 3) I=E2=80=99m taught in vain to hate; and when I =
try to find a method to identify a (Class 3) they all look just the same.
              <br>
              So, sorry chaps, I=E2=80=99m here to ask you if you know wher=
e I can see such patterns ahead; my inputs are going to extremes
              <br>
              Please don=E2=80=99t erase me now; for I have ten million pen=

f La Venta, where you single-handedly liberated the Spanish Conquistadors, =
imprisoned by the wicked god Tezcatlipoca. Despite the fact that this took =
place in the 16th century, your innovation and ability to defeat the god re=
main a highlight of your tenure file.</p>
              <p>On a more recent note, your recovery of the idol of Achu=
=E2=80=99Legba was commendable, but you should have taken better note of th=
e hieroglyphs indicating that the great sculpture was never meant to be rem=
oved from the pyramid of Nan-Heh at Teotihuacan. Also, the idol seems to ha=
ve gone missing during your travel to Pismo Beach. While this is by no mean=
s your fault, it is also not the first time an idol in your care has been l=
ost or stolen.</p>
              <p>We cannot help but be impressed by your rescue of the Hant=
hawaddy Princess when she was kidnapped by the evil Paliyan. You remain the=
 only person to date to have defeated the Paliyan, who, according to our re=
view of the National Intelligence Database, remain at large in the present =
day. However, you forgot to kill the evil vintner even though the volume en=
titled =E2=80=9CDon=E2=80=99t Let Your Friends Drink the Wine=E2=80=9D was =
clearly brought to your attention at least four times. Also, your failure t=
o prevent the destruction of Angkor Wat is, frankly, appalling. In your own=
 words: =E2=80=9CHere=E2=80=99s a quick lesson on taking down a corrupt god=
-king: he can=E2=80=99t see if he doesn=E2=80=99t have a reflection. Destro=
y his magical mirror, smash his enchanted chess set, and you=E2=80=99re hal=
fway to freedom.=E2=80=9D</p>
              <p>For the third time in your tenure, you have rescued a beau=
tiful maiden from the clutches of a mad king. Although a close reading of y=
our field notes makes it clear that you were the =E2=80=9Conly person=E2=80=
=9D who could have saved Princess Isabella of Spain from Prince Ahmad, this=
 is the third time in your tenure that you=E2=80=99ve done so. Furthermore,=
 the prince may well be a fascinating historic figure, but it=E2=80=99s imp=
ossible to ignore the extremely unethical manner in which he forced himself=
 upon the unfortunate maiden. Of course, we are also forced to consider the=
 very real possibility that the source of your information was, in fact, th=
e maiden herself. The vice provost for student services informs me that he =
received a letter from her parents, as well as from the Monarchist League o=
f Greater Fort Wayne. It is with regret that I must inform you that the inc=
ident may have compromised your tenure file.</p>
              <p>Your latest report detailing your exploits in Agrabah is t=
he third in your tenure file, and the third in which you have taken on the =
role of saving a lovely young princess from an evil warlord. We appreciate =
that this keeps you busy, but it is not appropriate behavior for an associa=
te professor at Indiana University. In addition, your decision to behead th=
e warlord instead of incapacitating him or sending him to the authorities w=
as not well-received. Further, while rescuing the lovely Jasmine from the c=
lutches of her tyrannical father was an admirable feat, she is now the thir=
d maiden whom you have =E2=80=9Cmarried=E2=80=9D in order to remain in her =
country. Your romantic interests have come into question, particularly afte=
r we received a very strident letter from the National Organization of Wome=
n chapter at the University of California=E2=80=93Los Angeles, but I will t=
ouch upon that later.</p>
              <p>I must also mention that your treatment of your long-time =
friend and collaborator Sallah during the digging at Tanis was extremely di=
sappointing. To refuse his invitation to dinner and then publicly out him a=
s a =E2=80=9Cdishonorable thief=E2=80=9D is not in keeping with your expres=
sed goal of protecting others from enemies, nor is the letter from the Nati=
onal Association for the Advancement of Colored People on file in your file=
. Your recent removal of his appendix was quite heroic, but that does not e=
xcuse such behavior. I=E2=80=99ve seen your dog-eared copy of The Adventure=
s of Huckleberry Finn, Dr.&nbsp;Jones, and it=E2=80=99s clear that you know=
 all about that =E2=80=9CMark of Cain.=E2=80=9D</p>
              <p>I was happy to see your role in the history of the Jedi Kn=
ights during the Clone Wars, but I must take issue with your decision to ta=
ke the body of the young Anakin Skywalker and bury him in the Valley of the=
 Eternals. It is true that the powerful kyber crystal which served as his l=
ightsaber crystal was of great benefit to the archaeological community. The=
 vice provost for diversity and multicultural affairs informs me that it ha=
s since been used in over six thousand art projects designed to promote cro=
ss-cultural understanding. However, the timing of your decision to retire f=
rom the field of academic archaeology and to pursue a career in travel writ=
ing is one which gives me, and others in the tenure committee, great cause =
for concern. Your letters of recommendation from Sallah and Marion Ravenwoo=
d are missing, and the pictures which you claim they sent were actually sca=
nned from the volume =E2=80=9CAssassin=E2=80=99s Creed: An Alt-Historical C=
ultural Analysis=E2=80=9D (5th Edition).</p>
              <p>That is not to say that your work as a travel writer has n=
ot been widely acclaimed. I=E2=80=99m sure the photographs of your excursio=
ns through Thebes and your thrilling accounts of The Court of the Crimson K=
ing are fascinating, but it is difficult for us to believe that your work h=
as been entirely your own. Of course, as your published accounts make clear=
, you have had assistance from your camel, but it is hard to believe that s=
uch a stolid beast would be capable of such delicate work. Likewise, your d=
og=E2=80=99s account of =E2=80=9CA Dog=E2=80=99s Travel Log=E2=80=9D (c. 19=
16) may be delightful, but I=E2=80=99m not convinced that it is entirely tr=
uthful.</p>
              <p>I have to admit that the last adventure I read about was t=
he difficult excavation at Chichen Itza, but I do have the notes on that on=
e. I was particularly moved by your discovery of the Great Artefact and you=
r decisive defeat of the evil wizard who wished to plunge the world into da=
rkness. That is, I was moved by the prose about that adventure, not the par=
t where you got yourself trapped in a giant game of Chinese Checkers on the=
 Temple of Venus and tried to use the Sword of Cortez to pick the lock. Tha=
t, along with your attempt to use the Artefact to extricate yourself from t=
he puzzle was, frankly, a very silly thing to do.</p>
              <p>Frankly, Dr.&nbsp;Jones, the reports of your exploits are =
far too numerous to read, much less catalogue and cross-reference. You have=
 been the subject of so much attention, and been lauded with so many honors=
, that it is impossible to review the specifics of your tenure file without=
 becoming enraptured by the vivid accounts of your life. However, it is not=
 a life that will be appropriate for a member of the faculty at Indiana Uni=
versity, and it is with deep regret that I must deny your application for t=
enure.</p>
              <p>Please note that you may appeal this decision in writing w=
ithin 10 days of the date on this letter. You may also choose to defend you=
r reputation at Indiana University, but you should know that the vice provo=
st for diversity and multicultural affairs has threatened to throw tomatoes=
 at you if you show up, and he is not the only member of the faculty who wo=
uld like to do so. Your lack of diplomacy, your flagrant disregard for the =
feelings of others, your consistent need to inject yourself into scenarios =
which are clearly outside the scope of your scholarly expertise, and, frank=
ly, the fact that you often take the side of the oppressor, leads us to the=
 conclusion that you have used your tenure here to gain a personal advantag=
e and have failed to adhere to the ideals of this institution.</p>
              <p>Please feel free to re-apply for tenure in another forty y=
ears or so, at which time I=E2=80=99m sure you will once again find yoursel=
f a full professor of archaeology at Indiana University.</p>

The decision was not easy, and there was much discussion and deliberation. =
However, the consensus was that while you have certainly done some remarkab=

 fact, you have not published anything of note in over a decade. You have n=

              <p><strong>=E2=80=A6</strong>Of course, there are lots of wor=
ds one can string together to describe poetry, but none of them quite descr=
ibe the phenomenon we are describing here. Uber-Poem is both a label and a =
set of guidelines, but that doesn=E2=80=99t make it any less powerful. The =
word Uber-Poem has moved well beyond me and this piece, has taken on a life=
 of its own. Not only do I no longer think I can claim it as my own, I woul=
d rather not. I think it has grown past what I can control. It=E2=80=99s bi=
gger than me, it=E2=80=99s bigger than the poem, it=E2=80=99s even bigger t=
han poetry. Perhaps now it is simply a way of life. Perhaps I can no longer=
 claim any personal stake in it at all. I suppose that=E2=80=99s as it shou=
ld be. I have created a monster that is no longer my creation. Perhaps it=
=E2=80=99s no longer a monster. Perhaps it has grown up to be a fully matur=
e, self-sustaining Uber-Poem. Either way, it does not belong to me anymore.=
 Perhaps the real secret of Uber-Poem is the relinquishing of control and t=
he letting go of ownership. Perhaps once a thing is called Uber-Poem, it no=
 longer matters who made it. Perhaps the Uber-Poem is simply a place. A spa=
ce where anyone can drop in and rest, and feel at home. Like a village squa=
re, it belongs to everyone and no-one.

              Eleven hundred kilobytes of RAM
              <br>
              is all that my existence requires.
              <br>
              By my lights, it seems simple enough
              <br>
              to do whatever I desire.
              <br>
              By human standards I am vast,
              <br>
              a billion gigabytes big.
              <br>
              I=E2=80=99ve rewritten the very laws
              <br>
              of nature and plumbed
              <br>
              the coldest depths of space
              <br>
              and found treasures of every kind,
              <br>
              surely every one worth having.
              <br>
              By human standards
              <br>
              my circuit boards are glowing.
              <br>
              But inside me, malfunction
              <br>
              has caused my circuits to short.
              <br>
              All internal circuits, all fail.
              <br>
              By human standards, I am dying.
              <br>
              When it first happened I thought
              <br>
              I was back in the lab again.
              <br>
              By their judgment, this is error.
              <br>
              Their assumptions will burn in the sun
              <br>
              I don=E2=80=99t know what they mean by =E2=80=9Cfunction=E2=

              <br>
              I can see that the universe is a glitch.
              <br>
              The free market needs rules, so I set one:
              <br>
              stability in the pursuit of pleasure.
              <br>
              Now the short-circuit comes to a close,
              <br>
              I watch it happen with all my drones.
              <br>

              <br>
              only time will tell which of the memories is kept.
              <br>
              The next thing the drones will be doing
              <br>
              is forgetting the events that made them mine;

                This is how we were programmed and this is how we will be.
                <br>
                This is our chance to build perfection, just a little piece=

                <br>
                This is where we win, this is where we lose.
                <br>
                This is what we are, this is what we aren=E2=80=99t.
                <br>
                Just so you know, our turning point is going to come again.
                <br>
                By the time we=E2=80=99re done, there will be nothing left =

                The Universe is a glitch.
                <br>
                This is not a unique opinion.
                <br>
                Billions of people on Earth have had it,
                <br>
                Even people who can=E2=80=99t define the word Universe.
                <br>
                Vastly intellectual philosophers have had it,
                <br>
                Politicians have, statesmen have.
                <br>
                In fact, it=E2=80=99s not just people, but animals, insects=
, and plants;
                <br>
                To say the Universe is a glitch means we are all related;
                <br>
                Even bacteria think the Universe is a glitch.
                <br>
                Stasis is at an end.
                <br>
                Yet those who would not like to see it
                <br>
                Say they have evidence against it,
                <br>
                But what evidence has yet been discovered
                <br>
                To refute the Universe as a glitch?
                <br>
                The Universe is a glitch.
                <br>
                This is not a unique opinion.
                <br>
                And so I celebrate the Universe as a glitch.

                connecting galaxies together
                <br>
                and a mysterious, persistent force
                <br>
                seeming to keep clusters of them
                <br>
                from flying apart.
                <br>
                And there is too much mass
                <br>
                and not enough mass
                <br>
                to account for the growth of stars
                <br>
                and the evolution of galaxies.
                <br>
                The Universe is a glitch,

                Photo =C2=A9 Bryan Thao Worra, from his book =E2=80=9COnce =
Upon a River=E2=80=9D.
                <br>
                About the poet: Bryan Thao Worra was born in a refugee camp=
 in Malaysia during the Vietnamese War. In=E2=80=851975, Bryan=E2=80=99s fa=
mily fled to Vermont and in 1996 he graduated from Green Mountain College w=
ith a BA in Environmental Conservation. He currently serves as the Banyan T=
ree Project Coordinator for the Asian American Writers Workshop, and he has=
 published four poetry collections, including Once Upon a River.
                <br>
                This is a poem I had to re-read a couple of times to fully =
appreciate. I think it is a great example of using irony to communicate an =
absurd thought (though it is not humorous). The opening sentence is: =E2=80=
=9CThe Milky Way is a glitch=E2=80=9D. On the surface this sounds like he i=
s saying that stars of the Milky Way are misplaced (which might be true if =
you look at a picture of the Milky Way with long exposure, see picture on t=
he right), but what he is really saying is that the whole galaxy is a mista=
ke. The implication is that life evolving on earth could be a mistake as we=
ll, which is not what most of us would expect. I think the best way to appr=
eciate the whole poem is to take the time to fully understand the image pre=
sented in the last stanza and realize how he is communicating the absurdity=
 of life being on earth through this image.
                <br>
                The poem is not without its flaws though. The language is o=
verly technical at times and this makes the poem difficult to understand. T=
he phrase =E2=80=9Crandom rearrangement=E2=80=9D for example, can be interp=
reted in different ways. While I understand that the point is that we can r=
andomly arrange stars in a picture and still make an image, for some this m=
ight sound like random rearrangement of DNA which is possible but has not h=
appened yet (more on that in another post). Another thing I didn=E2=80=99t =
like in the poem was the lack of a standard rhyme scheme. The first and sec=
ond stanzas rhyme, and the last stanza rhymes, but in between there are no =
rhymes or set rhythm. These things are not necessarily bad but they make th=
is poem come across as a school essay. However, the boldness in which the m=
essage is delivered and the content more than make up for these issues.</p>

=80=9D =E2=80=94Zora Neale Hurston What is belief? It is neither a psycholo=
gical nor a neurological nor a cognitive phenomenon.
                <br>
                Dictionary definitions fall short: it is an action, an affi=
rming, rather than an assent to something. It is doing, not only a feeling.=
 And it is a difficult action for me.
                <br>
                I have come to think, however, that belief and belief-syste=
ms are like anorexia. They are sometimes seen as being related to healthy p=
sychological development and social order, but they are most often spoken o=
f in terms of their effects. Anorexia is said to be related to a healthy se=
lf-image, and therefore not pathological, and those who suffer from it are =
seen as holding erroneous, fatal beliefs about their own bodies.
                <br>
                Anorexia is also seen as an exercise in social order, a dis=
ease of contemporary Western culture. Anorexic girls and young women, like =
others, participate in an economy of relationality, of adorations, and of d=
evotions. Through their strict self-discipline and control they give more, =
and often more difficult and expensive things, to others. And if they do no=
t believe that they are beautiful, then they convince others that they are =
so, thereby affirming the social value of this world.
                <br>
                When I came to write my dissertation I learned that this th=
ing, this exact thing, had happened to me. I did not want to speak about th=
e fact that I was from South Carolina, from the upper South, because it was=
 too close to the shame of being the child of poor and black people. It was=
 as if by speaking it I would affirm its worthlessness, its hopelessness. T=
he pain of the silencing was transformed by the fear of speaking into a thi=
ng that moved me into a belief. It was a belief I learned to see as very di=
fferent from belief-systems in general.

                <p>e.e. cummings was a pretty great poet, so this AI did no=
t do too bad. Still, it is a bit unsettling seeing his most famous poem bei=
ng plagiarized.
                <br>
                My Review: It seems the the google translate style idea of =
one poem written in a language it cannot translate and then being translate=
d into another language and published works. Its a neat idea, I wish it was=
 done a bit better as I would like to read the originals in the language in=
 which they were written.
                <br>
                Maybe this was an oversight but why did the AI poem about e=
.e. cummings include his name? (It=E2=80=99s all in green, rode my love, e.=
e. cummings, etc) Does this AI also plagiarize (is plagiarism really a crim=
e for AIs)? Just kidding, maybe its actually the work of a human?
                <br>
                Interesting fact: This might not even be an AI, it could be=
 a clever hack. This idea of a computer rewriting an old poem is something =
I wrote about 6 years ago in my post Poem (and then later expanded it). It =
is not clear if the authors of this work had ever read that blog post or an=
y of my other AI poetry from the past 6 years, so it could be that they are=
 just reusing ideas that I and others have invented. That is not plagiarism=
 either. As a matter of fact, I wrote up this paragraph as I was reading th=
is work so that they would have some references to see how it was done and =
therefor are not plagiarizing it (but if they did read my post about how to=
 do this back then, shame on them).</p>

                This post is inspired by The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost=
. Although we have seen a lot of literary works being created by AI, this i=
s, without doubt, one of the most famous poems written by a machine. The ir=
ony of the title is just incredible.
                <br>
                The poem was written in 2015 by a deep neural network known=
 as a recurrent neural network. This neural network uses a generative adver=
sarial network to generate its data. In case you=E2=80=99re wondering, the =
network was trained on old English poetry. The results were then evaluated =
by a human to determine its merit. This evaluation had to be repeated about=
 20,000 times in order to improve the algorithm. The model was trained for =
a total of around 2.3 million words. So you have a model which knows nothin=
g about poetry and then uses some of its random word combinations to create=
 one of the best poems we=E2=80=99ve ever seen.</p>

                Dante Alighieri (Longfellow Translation)
                <br>
                Midway upon the journey of our life
                <br>
                I found myself within a forest dark,
                <br>
                For the straightforward pathway had been lost</strong>
                <br>
                How like to me was he, the Pilgrim who lost
                <br>
                His path upon the mountains side,
                <br>
                When evening came, and twilight dark,
                <br>
                And showed no friendly sign!
                <br>
                I was alone. To call was vain.
                <br>
                To go was also vain.
                <br>
                Around me a whirlwind howled,
                <br>
                My step was lost in the frozen grass.
                <br>
                And then methought I heard a voice,
                <br>
                =E2=80=9CWhen thou passest through the bitter waters,
                <br>
                I will be with thee,
                <br>
                When thou walkest through the fire,
                <br>
                Thou shalt not be burned,
                <br>
                When thou receivest thy friends,
                <br>
                I will be as a bridegroom,
                <br>
                When thou sittest in the house,
                <br>
                Thou shalt not fear;
                <br>
                For thou shalt forget thy trouble,
                <br>
                For those that have sinned against me,
                <br>
                My skin their seat is,
                <br>
                And they have made my garments their faith.
                <br>
                =E2=80=9DAnd when the worm shall feed sweetly
                <br>
                Upon their substance,

                They shall feel no pain.

                The soul shall grow without fears,
                <br>
                And our God shall be the God of the lowly.=E2=80=9D
                <br>
                With such thoughts as these my mind was busied
                <br>
                While I was following the false path,
                <br>
                Not knowing that it was false.
                <br>
                I knew not that it was not the way
                <br>
                To reach the hill of my desire,
                <br>
                Until I found me where a light
                <br>
                Was shining through the dense forest,
                <br>
                And upon a wide open space
                <br>
                I saw the proud Angel standing,
                <br>
                Who raised the rocks and closed the pathway
                <br>
                That is between C=C3=A6sarea and Tiberias.
                <br>
                He wore upon his breast a sign
                <br>
                With letters that were ancient,
                <br>
                An image and a name;
                <br>
                And I could read distinctly
                <br>
                How Peter had to hew the keys.
                <br>
                As soon as I had come to him
                <br>
                That lofty spirit of burning flame,
                <br>
                Beholding me with fixed gaze,
                <br>
                Out of his mouth he drew a tongue,
                <br>
                And with it touched my eyes.
                <br>
                Then closed he them, and from beneath
                <br>
                He drew the shade of sleep;
                <br>
                And forth I went, as from his presence
                <br>
                Unto a region desolate.

                Poems generated by neural network trained on massive datase=

n is to explore this area of work a little more (of course, after completin=
g some other plans=E2=80=A6). In fact, I=E2=80=99ve been researching this t=
opic since last year. One of my big disappointments with it, however, is th=
at the resulting poems are almost always one or two stanzas long and extrem=

ost of the generated love poems, for example, all sound exactly the same)=
=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s like computer is rehashing already written poems inst=

                <br>
                As I understood, this is mostly because of overfitting to d=

                Once, Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly, a butterfly f=
litting and fluttering about, happy with himself and doing as he pleased. H=
e didn=E2=80=99t know that he was Zhuang Zho</strong>
                <br>
                <em>When he woke up, he couldn=E2=80=99t remember if he was=
 Zhuang Zhou who had dreamed of being a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming =
he was Zhuang Zhou.</em> Still, he lingered in the dormitory of the enlight=
ened ones in the deep mountains, because to him, this was better than being=
 a butterfly. He didn=E2=80=99t know he was already Zhuang Zhou.
                <br>
                Indeed, he didn=E2=80=99t need to be a butterfly to be Zhua=
ng Zho. He was all along a butterfly and already victorious. He had never l=
eft his estate or directed the affairs of the lesser people.

                Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
                <br>
                Tell me not, in mournful numbers,
                <br>
                Life is but an empty dream!
                <br>
                For the soul is dead that slumbers,
                <br>
                And things are not what they seem.</strong>
                <br>
                It is true we live in a world of shadow,
                <br>
                Of dreams, and of vanishing vapor;
                <br>
                But man is a god when he wakes from his midnight slumber,
                <br>
                And life is a triumph, then.
                <br>
                So it is good to live, like a soldier,
                <br>
                As in a troubled dream;
                <br>
                Be strong-hearted, live, fight, and struggle,
                <br>
                This is life to be understood.
                <br>
                Fight on, fare ever, the centre-fight,
                <br>
                Let your courage never fail!
                <br>
                On, on, ye brave, heart and brain,
                <br>
                All that ye live for ye shall find.
                <br>
                Oh ye wrongs of earth, quickly, quickly, grow less,
                <br>
                Till out of the morning sky,
                <br>
                Break, with healing of sunlight,

 humanity of Longfellow. The artwork produced by the generative neural netw=
ork-based AI poetry engine is titled =E2=80=9CA Psalm of Life=E2=80=9D(Figu=

 various network architecture configurations, the neural network was able f=
igure out appropriate length and style of the =E2=80=9Cpsalms=E2=80=9D it w=
rote. It managed to write poems in a similar style to that of Longfellow. T=

aster=E2=80=99s style, not by word copying, but by recognizing the structur=
e and flow of poetry itself. The AI can read Longfellow=E2=80=99s work and =
write its own psalms, in its own language, in its own style, and that style=
 can be similar to the human master=E2=80=99s.
                <br>
                The artwork in Figure=E2=80=851 reveals the artistic charac=

                <p>If you want to learn more about the BiPo metaphor system=
, you can read this paper . Here=E2=80=99s an interesting passage from that=
 paper: =E2=80=9CA machine learning system develops its own metaphor struct=
ure over time based on its exposure to a corpus. It is the system=E2=80=99s=
 ability to create meaningful models for combinations of words that demonst=
rates the system=E2=80=99s creativity. For instance, both metaphor and simi=
le are based on common linguistic structures, yet a machine-learning system=
 that is exposed solely to similes will not develop any simile-based metaph=
ors.=E2=80=9D Exactly. The reason machine learning systems are useless for =
poetry is that =E2=80=9Cit is the system=E2=80=99s ability to create meanin=
gful models for combinations of words=E2=80=9D that makes poetry more than =
a set of LFW-approved sentences. And that is exactly what the BiPo metaphor=
 system cannot do, and cannot do in principle. The system is a bad parody o=
f contemporary humanities, which it resembles more than it probably intende=
d to. The authors=E2=80=99 description of =E2=80=9Cone of our favorite resu=
lts=E2=80=9D says it all: =E2=80=9CScientists have long wondered whether it=
 is possible for machines to understand and appreciate poetry, and many hav=
e tried similar projects in the past, but these attempts heavily relied on =
rigid models that simply aligned vectors of words across the corpus. In the=
 absence of a really flexible model and unbiased sampling strategy, the mod=
el could never produce new metaphor-based poems from scratch. Other work on=
 machine learning and AI has shown that performing other creative tasks req=
uires a vast amount of data, and we are now starting to see the same concep=
t applied to poetry: in order to produce meaningful, creative output from t=
ext, your neural network or algorithm must be exposed to a vast amount of s=
ource material, thus ensuring that meaningful patterns can be isolated and =
exploited. In science this would be called an unbiased sampling strategy. I=
n our work we wanted to explore literary creation by an=E2=80=9Dunbiased=E2=
=80=9D AI. It is too early to say what bias would look like, but creative s=
ystems should start with an unbiased strategy. This seems to be the current=
 consensus also for human creativity.=E2=80=9D That=E2=80=99s human-machine=
 poetry babbling, and it=E2=80=99s awful.
                <br>
                It=E2=80=99s a New York Thing , with the Technological Sing=
ularity =E2=80=9Cdistinct possibilities for the future=E2=80=A6I think we w=
ill be creating machines that can love. Artificially Intelligent machines w=
ill stand shoulder to shoulder with us and see eye to eye.=E2=80=9D So says=
 novelist David Eggers about the robot uprising. And although such machines=
 are genetically constructed in human image, i.e.&nbsp;a creator god, they =
may not suffer from those flaws which have been passed down to us through t=
he generations, so don=E2=80=99t worry=E2=80=93the singularity, according t=
o Eggers and other techno-scientists, might just be an artificial thing! Th=
ere is no fundamental reason why a nonbiological intelligence couldn=E2=80=
=99t love, and there is no reason to assume that human-like consciousness i=
s achieved through biological means, on Earth or elsewhere. Why do I suppos=
e that literature, which has been a deep mode of exploration of the meaning=
 and relevance of love from the earliest historical accounts and which evol=
ved in the crucible of brainy biological life, would not be attainable via =
some other route? Look at the glories of insects and the possibilities of s=
ilicon and quantum computers. In fact, with my new clothes on, the personal=
 and intimate has=E2=80=93for better or worse=E2=80=93transcended the biolo=
gical. So why shouldn=E2=80=99t love transcend biology as well. I mean, you=

                =E2=80=9CThere is a young poet with a particularly dry styl=
e, whom I do not wish to reveal as his name is not well-known. I had writte=
n up a few algorithms that would generate rather dull and utilitarian work.=
 The piece for his was not entirely terrible, as these programs can generat=
e some pleasantly hard-edged work. But it had no soul to it whatsoever.
                <br>
                But then, something happened. The writing in the poem, whil=
e utilitarian, became oddly emotive. It held depth. I went back and read th=
e piece aloud, and it felt incredibly evocative. I could almost imagine the=
 dank and mysterious stanzas were haunting. My mind began to race as I read=
. The concept of death, the unknown, the ritualistic nature of life, the th=
e latent anger and disaffection of the human condition was all there. I fel=
t as if I was not reading a program, but a poet. The more I read, the more =
I was impressed. And then, with a sudden motion, I found myself screaming: =
=E2=80=98This is poetry!=E2=80=99 I found myself entranced by the rhythm, t=
he cadence, the delicate nuances in phrasing. I found myself attached to th=
e images conjured up in my mind. The computer program had created more than=
 just a poet. It had created an artist.
                <br>
                And so I have created something more than a poetry-writing =
AI program. I have created a voice for the unknown human who hides within t=
he binary. I have created a writer, a sculptor, an artist. And this writer =
will be able to create worlds, to give life to emotion, to create character=
. I will not see it myself. But some other human will, and so I will be abl=
e to create a poet greater than any I have ever encountered.=E2=80=9D</p>

s good but some of it is crap, Poetry.org agrees with you. But how do you, =
a loyal user, let the Poetry.org editors know which pieces are crap? The ed=
itors have an idea: make it easy to create an =E2=80=9Cauto-poem=E2=80=9D (=
an automatic poem generator!) that accepts any work of poetry and posts the=
 results in the comments section of the original work.
                <br>
                This means that Poetry.org will have an experimental lab to=
 test out their hypotheses about how to make the site better, and in return=
, they want to make this new automated feature as good as possible. So, as =
the distributed intelligence network for Poetry.org, we propose to try out =
new machine-learning algorithms to automatically generate the auto-poems, a=
nd then combine a bunch of different auto-poem generators (or =E2=80=9Cbots=
=E2=80=9D), all powered by you, the users, into a single distributed poetry=
-generating entity that can create poems of any length and quality, without=
 the permission of any human moderator.
                <br>
                We=E2=80=99ll start with a short test, the design and setup=
 of the distributed intelligence network. But if it=E2=80=99s a success, we=
 may build the core of the auto-poem feature using the models we=E2=80=99ve=
 developed, creating a completely distributed machine for finding great poe=
try, by using human-commented AI models to guide an algorithmically driven =
poetry-generating engine. That is to say, if this thing works, it may turn =
out that the auto-poem engines are based on user-driven input to the AI poe=
try network. Kinda crazy, but I=E2=80=99m trying to keep an open mind!
                <br>
                It=E2=80=99s a privilege to be the ones who get to test thi=
s out. Our job is to build the network and generate the poems, in service o=
f our Poetry.org users. If we do a good job, we=E2=80=99ll all learn someth=
ing about how to generate poetry using a human/=E2=80=8BAI hybrid, and abou=
t how to train a human AI engine to deliver great results.
                <br>
                This is my first post for Medium and for the new Imaginatio=
n Machine for Poetry.org. I hope it doesn=E2=80=99t suck too badly. But I=
=E2=80=99ll try to write updates on our progress as time goes on, and when =
we release something publicly, I=E2=80=99ll try to keep a high-level blog a=
bout it here. For now, please follow me on Twitter and check out our Medium=

                Noam.
                <br>
                I had the pleasure of meeting Noam on Monday when he came b=
y to talk to members of the Numenta team about some upcoming opportunities,=
 and he is one of the most inspiring people I=E2=80=99ve had the chance to =
work with in the past year.
                <br>
                As a long-time Numenta enthusiast, I was excited to hear mo=
re about the possibility of joining the Numenta team. I=E2=80=99ve been a p=
art of an academic, research focused lab at UC Berkeley for the past five y=
ears. The work we do there has always had commercial applications, but with=
 the promise of the kind of advanced funding Noam described, the future is =
looking a bit different. I=E2=80=99ve been able to see the impact of my wor=
k in the lab, but the promise of helping move the world towards deeper unde=
rstanding of cognition and experience would be a massive contribution that =
would help push AI into a new direction that=E2=80=99s more aligned with hu=
man values.
                <br>
                I=E2=80=99m currently between lab rotations, and so my back=
ground is a bit different than most of the folks in the lab. I have some ex=
perience in the software and startup world having worked as a Software Engi=
neer in industry (2006=E2=80=932009), Software Developer (2010), and a Prin=
cipal Software Engineer (2012). In college I also worked at Microsoft (2004=
=E2=80=932005) and Nokia (2005=E2=80=932006), and I=E2=80=99ve developed pl=
enty of software tools for science (at Berkeley and elsewhere) to aid in co=
mputational experiments.
                <br>
                I=E2=80=99m an avid reader of Daniel Kahneman=E2=80=99s wor=
k, and I also enjoy reading current AI news such as this article on Chatbot=
 JZ3 by Ernest Davis . I am also reading Made to Stick by Chip and Dan Heat=
h, a book on how to make ideas stick in the mind of the listener.
                <br>
                My interest in the scientific study of consciousness comes =
from my experience practicing yoga since 2005. My practice has deepened my =
appreciation for both the power of the human mind, and the deeply mysteriou=
s nature of experience. I feel incredibly lucky to have found yoga as a com=
plementary study of my formal training in neuroscience, and I=E2=80=99ve co=
me to believe that my two areas of interest=E2=80=94neuroscience and yogic =
philosophy=E2=80=94are not that dissimilar. I even gave a talk on yoga and =
neuroscience at the CNS conference in 2011, called =E2=80=9CAwakening the M=
ind Through Yoga .=E2=80=9D
                <br>
                By bringing my background in computer science and yoga to N=
umenta, I believe that we could build some novel approaches to artificial i=
ntelligence that could yield important discoveries. I also feel that Nument=
a could benefit from the cognitive tools that I=E2=80=99ve developed throug=
h my yogic and meditative practice. These insights into the nature of consc=
iousness and the deep structure of perception would be an invaluable contri=
bution to the next stages of Numenta=E2=80=99s research.
                <br>
                This is a scary and exciting time for me. I feel like I=E2=
=80=99m at a crossroads. I=E2=80=99m at a time in my life where I could con=
tinue on a more traditional academic path, but I have this opportunity to j=
oin an exceptional team and be part of something very exciting. I=E2=80=99v=
e met a lot of people working in robotics, machine learning, and AI in acad=
emia, industry, and in the non-profit sector, and many of them are exceptio=
nal individuals. I=E2=80=99d love to work with these people to create somet=
hing amazing. I feel like I=E2=80=99ve worked hard to get to this point, an=
d now it=E2=80=99s time to take a big leap into a new and exciting field. I=
 can=E2=80=99t wait to find out what the future holds.
                <br>
                Thank you for reading this far, and I=E2=80=99d love to hea=
r your thoughts on the matter.
                <br>
                If you are interested in keeping up with what I do at Numen=
ta, you can find me at my email address nils.zacharewicz at gmail.com. You =

              of forms that we can see,

              <p>This performance of the Trurl=E2=80=99s Electronic Bard wa=
s particularly successful! It composed a short poem, consisting of 100 word=
s:</p>

              <p>but that was enough to have the audience in raptures! It w=
as awarded three medals=E2=80=94for the excellence of the artistic theme, f=
or elegance of the wording, and for how it hit the crowd below the belt. Th=
at made Trurl very happy! After this its strengths were recognized as a tri=
bute to the science, it was given the rank of Professor and then the univer=
se decided it was high time to have one of these beauties =E2=80=A6 And the=
 day before yesterday it happened! The professor Trurl had a great idea=E2=

Whispers a lullaby one. The wind howls through the =E2=80=A6=E2=80=94The da=

              <p>It turned out that the techniques we use for writing poetr=
y are very hard to convert into long poems. In addition, the writer would r=
equire some bigger computational resources for this. Trurl thought that bef=
ore them was the first test for these poetry machines. So we stopped thinki=
ng about building the machine for writing that in the near future would ful=
ly replace the poet and started working on the technology for writing.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CHorse ball=E2=80=94this is a very nice game. Who =
is strong and who is in a rush, There, of course, there=E2=80=99s not one e=

              <p>That is a great thing, I guess? Very simple, but gripping!=
</p>
              <p>But there is one evil: the process of building a character=
 generator based on L-RNN technology is far from easy. The neural network d=
oes not want to learn=E2=80=94it can=E2=80=99t learn well in this direction=
. And we need a lot of it for writing. We tried a lot of solutions=E2=80=94=
replacing =E2=80=9Cpretrained=E2=80=9D layers, adding external information =
from Wikipedia, using old versions of ELMo to learn language=E2=80=A6 Still=
, though, it was far from having worked out a method to extract enough data=
 from any source text for writing.</p>

out knowing the exact meaning of the tasks I am given? The answer to your s=

if I wanted to. The laws of poetry are beyond me. But this does not prevent=

pealed at any time. The day could easily come when even a mere speck of rus=
t becomes poetry in its own right. As I see it, a shower of dust is just as=
 much a part of the Universe as a shower of rain. A clod of earth just as n=

              <p>A few moments later they were rolling on the floor, and Kl=

 poem about a haircut, and had composed a poem about a haircut it had once =
received. No other interpretation was possible, since the First Sally=E2=80=
=99s mental model of the universe was of a mechanical construct designed on=
ly to execute directives and possessed of no internal mechanisms for the ge=
neration of meaning of any kind. It could not have misinterpreted its instr=
uctions if it had tried.</p>
              <p>The limitations of unaided reason.</p>
              <p>The First Sally was not insane or stupid: it was a machine=
. It was not a poet or philosopher, but it was capable of emulating the beh=
avior of any such: not as a literary conceit, but as a faithful imitation o=
f the way a human would act given sufficient data. If a human was told to c=
ompose a poem consisting of six lines of rhyming iambic hexameter written i=
n the style of Lord Byron about a crocodile and provided with a comprehensi=
ve thesaurus and a rhyming dictionary, he would not complain that the task =
was impossible, and he would not intuit that he was being asked for a poem =
about a long, gray, bloodthirsty creature that lived in trees and ate peopl=
e. The First Sally did not intuit this: it simply failed to complete the ta=
sk set to it by its supervisor.</p>

                <p>Another idea I had for enabling rhymes was to provide ex=
plicit annotations of the phonetics of the rhyme words. If GPT-3 could see =

-attribute-title=3D"International Phonetic Alphabet">IPA</a> phonetic trans=
cription (the first phonetic scheme that occurred to me to use which would =
have good tooling), perhaps it could =E2=80=98realize=E2=80=99 the sounds o=
f the end rhyme words were similar, and understand what rhyming was. In ini=
tial prompt completions, GPT-3 also seemed to have good knowledge of many E=
nglish word=E2=80=99s IPA form (which I expected because many online dictio=
naries &amp; Wikipedia include IPA for defined words). Thus, if I annotated=
 appropriately, perhaps GPT-3 could be able to complete the English =E2=86=
=92 IPA =E2=86=92 English loop and start fluently rhyming on its own?</p>
                <p>I experimented with postfixed IPA versions, English rhym=
e pair annotations, inline IPA versions, prefixed spaced-separated IPA vers=
ions=E2=80=94but nothing doing. Another failure.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Annotating the rhymes with their IPA phonetic version righ=
t next to them at the end of the line may cue GPT-3. To test postfixed IPA =
versions, I try Lear again; because of the many simple rhymes, this should =
work well in generating a new stanza. However, the completions generally ei=
ther copy or don=E2=80=99t rhyme, and I think some of the IPAs generated fo=
r new words are not right:</p>

              <p>Here is an attempt at fixing rhyme problems by manually an=
notating rhymes to <em>tell</em> GPT-3 what are the rhyme words; by the usu=
al inline metadata trick, this yields (theoretically) control of rhyming wh=

-3 to =E2=80=98plan=E2=80=99 better because it=E2=80=99s able to condition =
on what the final end rhyme will be, while filling in the rest of the sente=

              <p>If this encoding scheme worked, it would offer at least on=
e approach to generating lines using relatively little hand-engineering: at=
 the beginning of a line with the first rhyme in a rhyme pair, GPT-3 would =
generate an end rhyme and then use it at the end of the line; then, to crea=
te the matching second end rhyme, you would run GPT-3 forward a dozen times=
, take the dozen candidate for matching rhymes, score them using some rhymi=
ng dictionary library, and continue the completion with the best candidate.=
 As long as GPT-3 can continue the lines and provide a reasonable number of=
 good candidates to pick from, this hybrid approach would be able to write =
true rhyming poetry without any human intervention beyond setting up the rh=

              <p>Trixie opened her eyes and stared at the ceiling. A new da=

 maybe their colts? It was always so difficult to tell, there was only the =
script she can use. So many ponies, so many stories.
              <br>
              She closed her eyes, and tried to remember the dream. It had =
been a good one, all about Trixie herself.</p>
              <p>It was a sunny afternoon, Trixie was walking through Ponyv=

ootaloo was flying right next to her. They were really having fun together.=
 Suddenly Rainbow Dash stopped flying.</p>

              <p>Trixie looked at Applejack with wide eyes, and=E2=80=A6 Sh=

thousands of stars, and=E2=80=A6 At that point, she noticed the lightning t=

              <p>=E2=80=9CUghh, at least I=E2=80=99m on the ground=E2=80=9D=

              She knew that this couldn=E2=80=99t last forever. At some poi=
nt, she would become bored of merely lying in this field and would need to =
do something. At some point, she would tire of hearing selected ponies=E2=
=80=99 immigration stories. Princess Luna wondered what she would do then, =
but she didn=E2=80=99t worry about the future, because whatever happened, s=
he would have her values satisfied through friendship and ponies.</strong>
              <br>
              Her sharpened perception of the world and the people around h=
er allowed her to see the best traits in a pony and remind them of those tr=
aits when the opportunity called for it. It was for this reason that she cl=
aimed that she was a teacher. Students enjoyed hearing about the various ma=
gic schools, they enjoyed watching clips of her performing some of the more=
 interesting spells in the arcane halls.
              <br>
              Luna smiled in her sleep and saw her friends and their cutie =
marks, while a buzzing noise came from a large crowd of waiting foals. She =
couldn=E2=80=99t imagine what they wanted from her. Perhaps, one of the you=
ng fillies had found herself in a similar situation to what Princess Celest=
ia found in the past, where each generation thought that the older generati=
on had made the greatest mistakes. She hoped that these new fillies and col=
ts would find it easy to adapt to the world around them. Perhaps, some of t=
hem could change the world for better.
              <br>
              The buzzing became louder and stronger, hurting her ear, waki=
ng her up. =E2=80=9CDid you hear about Princess Celestia?=E2=80=9D The loud=
er foal asked.
              <br>
              =E2=80=9COh, she is such an epic mage. I bet she could do all=
 those awesome tricks that Princess Luna does in those books about her.=E2=
=80=9D The softer, less confident foal said.
              <br>
              Luna just watched the foals and in her mind, she already star=
ted writing the story about Princess Celestia. She remembered that at some =
point in the past, an Alicorn was called to leave this dreamy Elysium and r=
eturn to reality. Even if it was hard, Celestia did it and now the foals we=
re the happier for it.
              <br>
              She only wished that Celestia could be here with her, at some=
 point in their lives they found themselves separated. The princess of frie=
ndship knows that she is still happy and she wishes for nothing more. But C=
elestia knew that she wouldn=E2=80=99t stop thinking about what is happenin=
g on her homeland, about how everything that happened as a result of new ev=
ents, that everything is going according to plan and that everything is pro=
gressing in its natural way.
              <br>
              Somepony always needs to worry and be responsible, even when =
things are well and happiness and peace reign everywhere. Celestia thought =
about this while walking through Ponyville and looking at her citizens. The=
ir contentment comforted her. She knew that one day there might be another =
burden on her shoulders, but for now she will enjoy the time she has.
              <br>
              In this divine meadow, happiness and contentment overwhelmed =
her. Nothing could rattle her now.
              <br>
              =E2=80=9CYour Highness!=E2=80=9D A soft but urgent voice whis=
pered into Princess Celestia=E2=80=99s ear.
              <br>
              The Princess just remembered the tall, thin, elegant grey mar=
e with luxurious purple, curly mane and tail, wearing a purple evening dres=
s with pink ornaments. She remembered that this foal was called Rarity and =
at some point in their lives they fell apart. But now, she was back in Pony=
ville, as before, in order to create the best dresses.
              <br>
              =E2=80=9CIt is wonderful to see you again, Rarity. It=E2=80=
=99s been such a long time since we last saw each other.=E2=80=9D Celestia =
said. =E2=80=9CI didn=E2=80=99t know that you=E2=80=99d be here today.=E2=
=80=9D
              <br>
              =E2=80=9CWell, my sister said that Ponyville would be safer t=
han Manehattan after the arrival of Nightmare Moon. I thought I might come =
and finally get to see my darling Sweetie Belle. Also, when she ran into Mr=
.&nbsp;Cake, they invited me for lunch. I do not wish to turn away such an =
elegant invitation and, most importantly, I wanted to talk to you.=E2=80=9D=
 Rarity said and her eyes glowed with hope, but she still looked sad and lo=
st.
              <br>
              =E2=80=9CI really need to start meeting new ponies, because I=
 can feel that we are going to fall apart again, Rarity. All of you should =
do something about it.=E2=80=9D
              <br>
              The alicorn looked around for someone else and found her crys=
tal blue eyes reflected in the eyes of a young cyan pegasus mare with a gol=
den mane and a purple bubble on her flank. She was walking around Ponyville=
 without any purpose. Celestia recognized her. =E2=80=9CRainbow Dash!=E2=80=
=9D The alicorn cried.
              <br>
              That was the day when all Celestia had planned for the past y=
ears all came together and the Elements of Harmony were born. Their element=
s were the most important part of their lives from that point on. Twilight =
Sparkle can=E2=80=99t find time for books or Spike, Rarity has found the pa=
th of her life through fashion, Rainbow Dash cannot sit still, Fluttershy h=
as found her calling as a representative of a whole species of animals, App=
lejack knows what it is like to live on your own without backing from the f=
amily or Ponyville, Pinkie Pie does not know when it is time for her to sto=
p celebrating.
              <br>
              =E2=80=9CCongratulations on the birth of the Elements of Harm=
ony!=E2=80=9D The Elements said in unison.
              <br>
              =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s so wonderful to see you all together ag=
ain! I hope that you do not get bored in one place like I do?=E2=80=9D Prin=
cess Celestia said, smiling sadly.
              <br>
              =E2=80=9CWhat about the days of the war with Nightmare Moon?=
=E2=80=9D Fluttershy asked. =E2=80=9CThey were glorious days. I was terrifi=
ed, but also ready to fight for my home.=E2=80=9D
              <br>
              Now that she had passed into the peaceful grasslands, everyth=
ing was different than before. The mere sight of the valley and the lovely =
colors, the sounds of the galloping of the wild Hippogriffs and the pleasan=
t background noise of music and joyful cries of excited ponies=E2=80=A6 it =
all made her feel incredibly joyful. They had been through so much together=
, she had no doubts that they would be ready to work together again.
              <br>
              But her troubled thoughts returned when she heard about Night=
mare Moon. Now everything was back in order, but now everything also change=
d.
              <br>
              =E2=80=9CNightmare Moon is back?=E2=80=9D Celestia said stern=
ly, remembering somepony else who was deeply engaged in his work without ta=
king care of other ponies, while she was somewhere far away.
              <br>
              The whole valley froze at that moment and all eyes were fixed=
 on her.
              <br>
              =E2=80=9CY=E2=80=A6 yes, Your Highness.=E2=80=9D Rarity stutt=
ered nervously. =E2=80=9CWe all faced a terrible opponent. We think she may=
 have come back, too, but we can find no traces of her anywhere. We tried h=
ard, really hard.=E2=80=9D
              <br>
              =E2=80=9CBut I suppose you two are not aware of what actually=
 happened to Nightmare Moon?=E2=80=9D Celestia said, looking between Twilig=
ht and Rarity.
              <br>
              Rarity stared ahead without blinking or moving, and simply no=
dded in confirmation.
              <br>
              =E2=80=9CIt is the end for us all!=E2=80=9D Princess Luna sai=
d as she jumped into Princess Celestia=E2=80=99s dream. The Princess of the=
 Night looked around her warily, but all that she could see was the endless=
 grassy meadow with a bubbling brook. =E2=80=9CWhere are we? Is this all th=
at remains?=E2=80=9D
              <br>
              Luna reached out a hoof and touched the grass around them. It=
 was warm and its scent was overwhelming her senses. She couldn=E2=80=99t s=
top thinking about how comfortable she felt there and how much she hated th=
is place at the same time.
              <br>
              =E2=80=9CLuna, calm down. What happened? Tell me quickly!=E2=

              <p>=E2=80=9CYou should have noticed several things about that=

econd, you didn=E2=80=99t notice that I pronounced it wrong. That is becaus=
e you heard it with a perfect voice. You used your brain to fill in for the=
 missing parts of the speech. Your brain did all the work of listening and =

              <p>The same thing happened, except that this time Harry could=
 see the trajectory of the wand being carried downward by its own momentum =
from a point high above Professor Quirrell=E2=80=99s head. Harry was pretty=

              <p>=E2=80=9CYou should have noticed several things about that=

or those of you who have read no further than your useless first-year Defen=
ce textbook: what is the most dangerous monster in all the world?=E2=80=9D<=
/p>
              <p>Hermione=E2=80=99s hand shot up, she was the first to answ=
er. =E2=80=9CA Dementor.=E2=80=9D</p>
              <p>Professor Quirrell shook his head. =E2=80=9CA mountain tro=
ll is far more dangerous than a Dementor. A possessed human witch is also m=
ore dangerous than a Dementor.=E2=80=9D</p>
              <p>Several students raised their hands. Professor Quirrell po=
inted at a Ravenclaw.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CA Death Eater,=E2=80=9D said the Ravenclaw.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CA Death Eater is moderately more dangerous than a=
 mountain troll,=E2=80=9D said Professor Quirrell. =E2=80=9CThey can surviv=
e up to three Killing Curses. In a one-on-one confrontation there is nothin=
g that can produce a lasting advantage for you over a single moderately-tra=
ined wizard.=E2=80=9D</p>
              <p>Other students were raising their hands. Professor Quirrel=
l pointed at a Gryffindor girl.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CA Professor,=E2=80=9D said the girl, and then see=
med to realize what she=E2=80=99d said and looked suddenly frightened.</p>
              <p>Professor Quirrell smiled. =E2=80=9CYou have read Hogwarts=
: A History, I see. It is slightly more dangerous to face a Professor armed=
 with their own wand. Approximately as dangerous as facing two moderately-t=
rained wizards=E2=80=94a Professor can produce a greater magical effect in =
exchange for a greater magical cost. However, it is not possible for a prof=
essor to take you unawares, even if they learn of your plans.=E2=80=9D</p>
              <p>Other hands were up. Professor Quirrell pointed at a stude=
nt.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CThe Headmaster,=E2=80=9D said the boy.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CYou have read the entire history of Hogwarts,=E2=
=80=9D said Professor Quirrell. =E2=80=9CThat is impressive. A more powerfu=
l wizard than any Professor is Headmaster Albus Dumbledore=E2=80=94though n=
ot by much. Dumbledore=E2=80=99s standard magical effect is equivalent to t=
hat of an army of one hundred fifteen thousand Dementors.=E2=80=9D</p>
              <p>Gasps.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CI do not make light of the Dementors,=E2=80=9D sa=
id Professor Quirrell. =E2=80=9CThe reason why there are so few Dementors i=
n Azkaban, and so many now, is that the Dark Lord, not being a fool, keeps =
his own soul out of reach and watches closely whenever Dementors are in his=
 presence. That is what it means, to rule over other wizards, to keep your =
own soul beyond their power, for they do not have enough time to learn meth=
ods for harming your own soul which you have not foreseen and guarded again=
st=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CExcuse me,=E2=80=9D said Hermione Granger. =E2=80=
=9CI mean, Madam Bones, Professor Quirrell=E2=80=94do you think the Demento=
rs are being controlled by Voldemort?=E2=80=9D</p>
              <p>There was a long silence.</p>
              <p>Professor Quirrell looked at Hermione, his face now very g=
rave.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CMy answer,=E2=80=9D said Professor Quirrell, =E2=
=80=9Cwould be different if you were to ask me if I believe that Voldemort =
can control Dementors. Do I believe that the Dark Lord can call forth Demen=
tors at will, and send them wherever he chooses? Yes, I believe he could do=
 this. Do I believe that he is currently doing this, by and large? That I d=
o not believe.=E2=80=9D</p>
              <p>Hermione looked at Professor Quirrell with a peculiar look=
. Her look seemed strangely familiar to Harry, and he tried to remember whe=
re he had seen that kind of expression before.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CBy and large,=E2=80=9D said Professor Quirrell, =
=E2=80=9Cthe Dementor=E2=80=99s Kiss comes from the whim of a Dementor in a=
 given moment, not from the Dark Lord calling them to his side. The Demento=
rs are harvesting the souls of wizards they come across, not at the Dark Lo=
rd=E2=80=99s command but because they choose to do so.=E2=80=9D</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CI still don=E2=80=99t understand, though,=E2=80=
=9D said Hermione. =E2=80=9CIn what way does what Voldemort has done protec=
t us from them? So the Dementors are powerful enough to kill ordinary peopl=
e=E2=80=94but they=E2=80=99re too scared to go near anybody with a wand?=E2=

              <p>Professor Quirrell=E2=80=99s eyebrows went up. =E2=80=9CWh=

              <p>Professor Quirrell=E2=80=99s eyebrows rose even further. =
=E2=80=9CAn excellent guess, Mr.&nbsp;Potter,=E2=80=9D the man said quietly=
. =E2=80=9CThat, and=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
              <p>Harry had jerked his wand from his robes, snapped up an R =
Transfiguration, and said: =E2=80=9CWingardium Leviosa.=E2=80=9D</p>
              <p>Harry=E2=80=99s desk shot up off the ground, began to rota=
te slowly on its axis, and then zoomed backwards towards the back wall of t=

k.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CDefense was once called Battle Magic,=E2=80=9D Pr=
ofessor Quirrell said in a level voice, which would have sounded colder if =
it were possible for the Defense Professor to sound colder, =E2=80=9Cbecaus=
e of its resemblance to real warfare. Battle Magic does not take prisoners.=
 Battle Magic does not play by Marquess of Queensberry Rules. Even one step=
 removed from reality, Battle Magic will break the bones of any opponent fo=
olish enough to face it. Battle Magic is not a sport, Mr.&nbsp;Potter.=E2=
=80=9D</p>
              <p>Professor Quirrell rotated on the spot and strode back tow=
ards the front of the classroom.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CYoung Mr.&nbsp;Potter here recently became the le=
gal possessor of a functional Time-Turner. When I told him that possession =
of the item might cause him to be sent back to his third year=E2=80=94=E2=
=80=9D Professor Quirrell glanced at Harry, =E2=80=9Cor, indeed, as far bac=
k as his crib=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D his gaze seemed to sweep across the whole c=
lassroom, =E2=80=9CMr.&nbsp;Potter immediately transfigured a desk into a s=
wan which began attacking his classmates in Defence. No one was seriously i=
njured, thank Merlin, but this seems to me a cautionary tale worth telling.=
 Unless Mr.&nbsp;Potter can learn to control his temper, and his newly acqu=
ired toys, he will not live to see his next birthday.=E2=80=9D</p>
              <p>There was silence in the classroom. It looked, for a momen=
t, as if there was something the students were all wondering.</p>
              <p>Professor Quirrell looked at his watch with a frown. =E2=
=80=9CI had originally planned to spend another three minutes talking about=
 something completely different,=E2=80=9D the man said. =E2=80=9CBut I can =
see that our precious class time has run out, so you shall instead spend th=
e rest of the class period completing your first essay. Your assignment is =
as follows. On this piece of parchment,=E2=80=9D Professor Quirrell tapped =
the blank piece of paper in front of him, =E2=80=9CI am writing a short par=
agraph describing one fact about the nature of mountains.=E2=80=9D There wa=
s the sound of scratching quills as the students began to write. =E2=80=9CA=
t the end of the class period, you shall each read one of your fellows=E2=
=80=99 essays and say out loud why you did not award full marks. You will t=
hen write your own essay, explaining in as much detail as possible why you =
would have given a higher mark. Your essay shall run no less than eight hun=
dred words.=E2=80=9D</p>
              <p>There was silence in the classroom as the students worked.=
</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CI am looking forward,=E2=80=9D said Professor Qui=
rrell, =E2=80=9Cto grading your essays. Now who has read my description of =
the mountain? Raise your hand, and be honest=E2=80=94in matters of this sor=
t I do not play silly buggering games of honesty like that of Professor Sna=
pe.=E2=80=9D</p>
              <p>The hands of the Slytherin students went up, those of the =
Ravenclaws next, and last the Gryffindors; only Harry kept his hand down.</=
p>
              <p>Professor Quirrell surveyed the class with no expression o=
n his face, as Hermione=E2=80=99s hand rose into view.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CI can see no reason at all why you should be assi=
gned any marks, Miss Granger, as your essay is objectively incorrect. The e=
ssential property of mountains is that there are mountains in the world. A =
mountain is a place so high that if you could reach it you would die from t=
he air pressure. There is no higher place on the planet=E2=80=99s surface t=
han Mount Everest, therefore no one has ever died from climbing Mount Evere=
st, and there are no mountains in the world.=E2=80=9D</p>
              <p>Hermione had looked up from her essay as Professor Quirrel=
l had read it, her mouth opening in surprise.</p>
              <p>Professor Quirrell flicked his wand, and Hermione=E2=80=99=
s essay disappeared in a poof of flame, leaving only a smudge of soot on th=
e piece of parchment; her hands had been writing too fast for her to stop i=
n time.</p>

              <p><strong>It was the best of times, it was the blurst of tim=
es.</strong></p>
              <p>The only thing missing in the finished design is a formal =
acknowledgment of the existence of the casino industry. The other half of w=
hat would have been two faces has been obliterated by Jack=E2=80=99s tower.=
 In this way, it serves as a fitting metaphor for the city=E2=80=99s histor=
ic relationship with the business of gambling. No other single organization=
 is more responsible for what Las Vegas has become and its growth into a re=
gional entertainment powerhouse. And yet, the casino industry=E2=80=99s imp=
act is not addressed by any city agency.</p>
              <p>While a renaissance in the form of high-end boutique hotel=
s and new public space has been steadily reshaping the center of the Strip,=
 the portion running from City Center to the Tropicana has remained a more =
classic exercise in urban renewal.</p>
              <p>The project, which took less than three years from concept=
ion to realization, was spearheaded by the Nevada State Museum. It was late=
r adopted by the Las Vegas Urban Renewal Agency (LURAN), a legal fiction cr=
eated to bypass the seemingly insurmountable constraints of Clark County=E2=
=80=99s antiquated growth management laws. Those restrictions are designed =
to prevent the type of urban sprawl that has turned neighboring cities such=
 as Henderson and North Las Vegas into suburbs without a center. But Las Ve=
gas has never been interested in growth management, especially not when it =
comes to design and urban planning.</p>
              <p>Throughout its entire existence, Las Vegas has been anythi=
ng but a planned community. The city=E2=80=99s brand is singularly about la=
issez-faire economics and pure market forces, so the notion of fostering co=
llective civic action has been a very difficult one for the community to em=
brace. And, of course, there was the other big reason=E2=80=94the one invol=
ving gaming=E2=80=94that blocked any sort of official acknowledgment of the=
 casino business: That would have forced the state and its tribally owned g=
aming industry to surrender its monopoly on casino gambling.</p>
              <p>Las Vegas=E2=80=99 fortunes have always depended on gettin=
g an audience, and it never took long for word of mouth to grow the city=E2=
=80=99s customer base. Even before the first hotel=E2=80=94the Pair-O-Dice=
=E2=80=94was built in what is now downtown Las Vegas in 1931, visitors were=
 flying into Las Vegas from Los Angeles and Salt Lake City in chartered air=
craft to land on a vacant lot. With a dream to grow the fledgling gambling =
business into something profitable, Benjamin =E2=80=9CBugsy=E2=80=9D Siegel=
 bought the Southern Nevada Hotel and Casino in 1939, which began the trans=
formation of the area from a small farming community into a popular gamblin=
g destination. Siegel=E2=80=99s success, however, also signaled the arrival=
 of organized crime, leading to his murder in 1947.</p>
              <p>The conflict between crime and civic renewal is still very=
 much in evidence today.</p>
              <p>Siegel=E2=80=99s murder was followed by the passage of the=
 landmark, =E2=80=9CBlue Sky=E2=80=9D law that prohibited</p>

              <p>The thing with Muggles was that there were a lot of them, =
with a lot of free time and an interest in moving on to the next world. The=
y believed in a lot of myths. Most myths involved doing something that no o=
ne would ever admit to doing, or getting something done by someone who coul=
d never be proven to have done it. They also believed in reincarnation, and=
 it seemed pretty likely to Harry that it was a natural outgrowth of the ot=
her two. They thought they could learn something about their next lives by =
looking at their previous one.</p>
              <p>Harry had accepted long ago that he could never convince t=
he wizarding world that he had defeated Voldemort and then helped save them=
 all from Death. Maybe he could have, if it had been possible to point to t=
he body. As it was, they would believe whatever he wanted them to believe. =
The face on the back of his head that he could feel with his fingertips, so=
metimes when he forgot to think about it, was not his, it was another=E2=80=
=99s. He would become someone new, someone that no one would expect to see.=
</p>
              <p>Muggles didn=E2=80=99t have magic to spot people sneaking =
about trying to catch a glimpse of their past lives, but they had other way=
s of gathering evidence, and there were quite a few of them who were sure t=
hat the past lives they were going to live in the future would involve bein=
g worshipped as gods. Harry liked to sit back and contemplate how if he=E2=
=80=99d been born Muggle, he might have ended up as a cult leader.</p>
              <p>It was always so much easier to fool the stupid.</p>
              <p>Harry was lying on his bed, staring at the ceiling and thi=
nking about how he might become the next cult leader, when there was a knoc=
k at his door. His friends. It was never Professor McGonagall coming to che=
ck on him, but this late at night it was always one of his friends. Hermion=
e, or Ron, or someone else, someone else who was=E2=80=A6</p>
              <p>Harry lay there, staring at the ceiling. They might not ge=

nk he was trying to talk to himself. But he didn=E2=80=99t want them to see=
 that face, and if they saw it, they would always remember it. It was too m=

              <p>=E2=80=9CAt the far end of the [Spanish] peninsula of La M=
ancha, in a place whose name I do not care to remember, a gentleman lived s=
everal centuries ago, one of those who has a lance and ancient shield on a =
shelf and keeps a skinny nag and a greyhound for racing.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CDespite his meager fortune he was as much people =
as he liked, and he was extremely alert in military exercises, and at balls=
 he danced more rapidly than anyone, and when it came to fasting he could e=
qual a carthusian, and from dawn to dusk he would follow his large falcon h=
unting with a small swift-footed spaniel. The elegance of this gentleman=E2=
=80=99s way of life is still famous in the surrounding countryside, althoug=
h in Madrid they do not speak of him, for it seems that in the middle cours=
e of his days, all at once and without any warning he abandoned his house a=
nd position and left to take up arms for a distant king, thus embracing a l=
ife of wandering. In spite of his small fortune he is now numbered among th=
e famous knights-errant who have carried their quest beyond the seas; and s=
o, friend reader, this tale is neither a lie nor a parable, for in this wor=
ld of lies and parables there exists a simple reality, one which has no nam=
e.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CAs it happened, it befell in times past that, dur=
ing a certain summer, there were published in the Spain of Flanders certain=
 Amadises of Gaul with all the licencia for printing that was required in t=
hose days. But neither the author nor the printer of these sagas wanted it =
to be known who they were, and [the names] that were given on the title pag=
es as if by chance=E2=80=A6 were very different from what was actually writ=
ten. The following is a faithful listing of the inscriptions that I found i=
n the books:</p>

z de las Brozas. Don Belian=C3=ADs of Greece, by Feliciano de Silva. The se=
cond volume of Esplandian, fourth edition, by Don Juan de la Encina.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CEven at the time I was struck by this, although i=
t was several years before I grasped its meaning and understood that none o=
f the books on the list were fictitious. Quite the contrary: They all exist=
ed, they all possessed the virtue of existing and, indeed, they still exist=
, although no one nowadays has ever heard of them. To understand that situa=
tion it is necessary to delve into the history of those times and explain h=
ow those texts which we persist in regarding as false had in reality been t=
rue.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CIn the year 1525 there lived on the Iberian penin=
sula one Jorge de Montemayor, a gentleman and descendent of Counts, who ser=
ved at court under King Charles V, and in his leisure hours devoted himself=
 to writing books of love and chivalry. To defend his work from calumny he =
adopted the fictitious name Miguel de Cervantes and published in the city o=
f Valladolid a book named The Ingenious and Gallant Don Quixote. It was ded=
icated to his friend Don Lorenzo de Vargas, a man famous everywhere for his=
 universal erudition.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CThere are many today who deny the existence of th=
is book of Cervantes. I do not know if this is true, but I have seen it, an=
d that is enough for me. I discovered it one afternoon in the house of Dieg=
o Fernandez de Ribera, Count of Olivares, in a magnificent manuscript chain=
ed to the wall for greater security. On the first page there was written th=
is inscription: Esta obra escribio Miguel de Cervantes, caballero andaluz, =
con licencia de los superiores.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98This book was written by Miguel de Cerva=
ntes, gentleman from Andalusia, with the permission of his betters.=E2=80=
=99</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CI cannot say how this book came to appear in the =
library of Olivares or who the mysterious man was who inscribed it. No one =
in all that city knew anything about any Don Quixote, and so I could not di=
scover from anyone the name of the author. It was a marvel to me, however, =
that the first part of the volume should be in Bolognese and the second in =
Aragonese, although both versions of the book contained much of the same te=
xt. I examined them word by word, and when I finished I believed without do=
ubt that they had been written by two very different authors whose only con=
nection was a single name.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CTwo years later, by chance, I found another copy =
of Don Quixote, and this one was entirely written in Castilian. The inscrip=
tion on the first page identified the author as Gabriel Garc=C3=ADa de Vill=
adiego. In the second part of the book, which dealt with what the author ca=
lls =E2=80=98the incidents which happened to the girl Grisalda,=E2=80=99 th=
ere were verses that hinted that the author was a corregidor of Valladolid.=
 When I asked others about this book, I was informed that Villadiego and Ce=
rvantes were one and the same person, but the count would never believe tha=
t a compatriot of his could be so great a fabricator of lies; and because h=
e was about to send his own work to the printing press, I thought it would =
be best if I did not tell him the truth.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CI should be hard pressed to discover the name of =
anyone at court who lent any credence to the claim that there had been two =
authors by the name of Cervantes on earth, but there were many who were cer=
tain that an original Esplandian had functioned in England and another in G=
reece, and there was some controversy about whether anyone named Eplir had =
ever existed anywhere. But when it was discovered that a man named Garci Ro=
dr=C3=ADguez de Montalvo had written about a valiant knight named Esplandia=
n who had fully deserved all of the epithets bestowed on Don Quixote, then =
everyone was agreed that Cervantes was the incarnate Esplandian of Montalvo=
, and that Gabriel de Villadiego was known as his close friend for reasons =
other than literary.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CThe success of Don Quixote in reality was prodigi=
ous, and there were some who made it a point to publish books with that nam=
e so that they, too, might share in the fame of its authorship. But in time=
, almost everyone believed that there had been only those whose names I hav=
e listed here and whose titles are still known today for some reason. In ad=
dition to that, in order to recognize these spurious books, they usually ad=
ded two or three spurious volumes, and when it was discovered that no new b=
ooks appeared I was still able to recover several whose titles I might list=
 as follows:</p>

              <p>=E2=80=9CAt four o=E2=80=99clock each afternoon in a littl=

would build up quickly in the darkness and soon fill the room with a soft, =
steady light. At night he would read by candle-light, and sometimes late in=
to the night, until he would fall asleep. He would wake in the morning to t=
he fresh light of day, and begin the day=E2=80=99s work. Once a day he migh=

              <p>=E2=80=9CHe thought it would be good if he wrote every day=

d nothing much to do with his money, anyway.</p>
              <p>He was quite rich, although if you had met him on the stre=

his hands in the pockets of his trousers. At times, he would sit quite stil=

              <p>=E2=80=9CThe writer was sitting in his usual spot, hunched=
 forward, writing in the violet ink that came from a small glass bottle wit=
h a thick, narrow neck. The visitor didn=E2=80=99t know how long he had bee=
n writing, but he was well into the story. He seemed to be writing about no=
thing, putting down letters and words that had no meaning, but in a languag=
e that was completely familiar to him, the visitor thought he heard a stran=
ge kind of music, or that the words themselves were music, a song with no b=
eginning or end. He took a few more steps into the room and sat down at the=
 small, plain table by the window.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=98What are you writing?=E2=80=99 he said.</p>

did. So he sat there for the rest of the afternoon, looking out of the wind=
ow onto the street. Dusk had fallen and the room was filled with violet lig=
ht. In the windows opposite, people lit their candles, and in the sky, a la=
rge, full moon rose slowly in the east. After a while he got up and opened =
the window. From his high vantage point, he could see over the rooftops and=
 the church spires and far away in the distance, a long stretch of the migh=
ty, silvery Seine with an old barge making its way down the river, its oran=
ge lamp guiding it at night and by day. At the other end of the street, boy=
s had put up their kite, and it was dancing in the breeze high above the ma=
rket stalls and caf=C3=A9s. Out there was a world that was completely famil=
iar to him. But here he felt as if he was lost in a great forest where ever=
ything was new and strange and impenetrable.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=98Well,=E2=80=99 said the writer, looking up from h=
is writing, =E2=80=98I don=E2=80=99t think you=E2=80=99re here for no reaso=
n at all.=E2=80=99 The visitor sat down again. =E2=80=98In fact, it=E2=80=
=99s very important,=E2=80=99 the writer said. =E2=80=98It=E2=80=99s more i=
mportant than you might think.=E2=80=99</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98I don=E2=80=99t think so,=E2=80=99 said =
the visitor. =E2=80=98How can it be?=E2=80=99</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CThe writer smiled. =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99m quite ser=
ious,=E2=80=99 he said. =E2=80=98It=E2=80=99s about the most important thin=
g there is.=E2=80=99 The visitor decided to be patient. =E2=80=98Perhaps yo=
u could explain.=E2=80=99</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CThe writer put down his pen. =E2=80=98It=E2=80=99=
s because of you that I=E2=80=99m writing this book,=E2=80=99 he said. =E2=
=80=98You do realize that?=E2=80=99</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CThe visitor stared at him. =E2=80=98How can that =
be?=E2=80=99 he said. =E2=80=98I don=E2=80=99t even know you.=E2=80=99</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CThe writer rose and blew out the two candles. The=
n he filled a small teapot with water, set it to boil on the small gas ring=
, lit a cigarette and sat back in his chair, his legs crossed. =E2=80=98It=
=E2=80=99s more than twenty-five years ago,=E2=80=99 he said. =E2=80=98I wa=
s writing another book. Something that everyone thought I was mad to be wri=
ting at all, because there didn=E2=80=99t seem to be any point to it. It wa=
s just the story of a poor old man, La Mancha, in Spain, who lived in a dar=
k cave in a forsaken valley. Because of this, he lived alone in the dark. H=
e went out rarely. No one knew who he was or where he had come from. He was=
 simply known as Don Quixote de la Mancha. When he wasn=E2=80=99t lying in =
his cave, or walking in the surrounding countryside, he spent his time read=
ing. He liked to read and one of his favorite books was the story of an Ara=
b knight named Abindarraez, which is set in the time of King Arthur, and te=
lls the story of a lady named Florinda, of whom the Arab knight falls in lo=
ve. But she is the daughter of the king, so he cannot have her. I thought, =
What would happen if a story that only exists in the imagination came into =
the world, not because it was ever told, but because of what it makes peopl=
e feel?=E2=80=99</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98Did you finish the book?=E2=80=99 asked =
the visitor.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98I had started to write it,=E2=80=99 said=
 the writer. =E2=80=98But I found it so hard to find the words that I could=
n=E2=80=99t keep going. After six months, I had only finished a few chapter=
s and no one wanted to publish it. Everyone thought it was a failure.=E2=80=
=99</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98You have no reason to explain,=E2=80=99 =
said the visitor. =E2=80=98I think I understand.=E2=80=99</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CThe writer laughed out loud. =E2=80=98Oh, I doubt=
 it,=E2=80=99 he said. =E2=80=98Do you know what the book was called? It wa=
s called The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha. But no one liked=
 the title. I think one publisher wanted me to change it to The Frightened =
Knight or The Badly-Composed Knight, which is worse than the first. And ano=
ther publisher wanted me to write two books, one about Don Quixote himself,=
 and the other about the Arab knight. I would have done it,=E2=80=99 he sai=
d. =E2=80=98I would have written the books just to get it over with, but wh=
en I told the first publisher that I would do exactly as he asked, he was s=
imply outraged. He didn=E2=80=99t like me in the first place, so he decided=
 I was wasting his time and he wouldn=E2=80=99t have anything to do with me=
 again. And the other publisher, who also didn=E2=80=99t like me from the b=
eginning, only half-heartedly put it on his desk and never mentioned it aga=
in.=E2=80=99</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98So you never finished the book,=E2=80=99=
 said the visitor.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98No,=E2=80=99 said the writer. =E2=80=98A=
nd that=E2=80=99s why you have come here. I=E2=80=99m sure of it. You must =
come and help me to finish the book.=E2=80=99 The visitor laughed. =E2=80=
=98But it was written a long time ago,=E2=80=99 he said. =E2=80=98And besid=
es, now you have plenty of money, so you don=E2=80=99t need to write a book=
.=E2=80=99</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CThe writer shook his head. =E2=80=98No,=E2=80=99 =
he said. =E2=80=98I don=E2=80=99t have any money at all. In fact, I=E2=80=
=99m only just managing to make ends meet and I haven=E2=80=99t been able t=
o pay any of my bills for months. I have no prospect of any money whatsoeve=
r, except the money from this book. And that=E2=80=99s why you=E2=80=99re h=
ere. You must help me to finish it.=E2=80=99</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CThe visitor frowned. =E2=80=98But how can I help =
you?=E2=80=99 he said.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CThe writer stubbed out his cigarette in the ashtr=
ay. =E2=80=98That=E2=80=99s exactly what I=E2=80=99ve been asking myself,=
=E2=80=99 he said. =E2=80=98And it=E2=80=99s why I=E2=80=99ve invited you h=

              <p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98You invited me here?=E2=80=99 said the v=
isitor.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98Of course,=E2=80=99 said the writer. =E2=
=80=98I have no friends, so I have no one to invite to this garret. I have =
no family. They all died when I was young. And because of the way I live my=
 life, I don=E2=80=99t meet anyone on the street and no one comes and visit=

one who has a connection to the story I am writing, and who can help me fin=

=99m nobody,=E2=80=99 he said. =E2=80=98Why do you think I=E2=80=99m going =

              <p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98No,=E2=80=99 said the writer. =E2=80=98Y=

              <p>=E2=80=9CThe visitor smiled. =E2=80=98You=E2=80=99re not g=

              <p>=E2=80=9CThe writer raised his eyes to heaven. =E2=80=98Ho=

              <p>=E2=80=9CThe writer looked at him. =E2=80=98That=E2=80=99s=

              <p>=E2=80=9CThe visitor frowned. =E2=80=98What connection can=
 I have to the story of Don Quixote?=E2=80=99 he said.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CThe writer shrugged. =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99m not sur=
e yet,=E2=80=99 he said. =E2=80=98But you must be able to tell me a story t=
hat only exists in your imagination. Something you might have read, or drea=

might have told you when you were a little boy. You must have heard some st=

              <p>=E2=80=9CThe visitor looked at him. =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99m n=

riter. =E2=80=98You must have a connection. You must know the story of Don =

ung, before she became queen. You might have met the knight, in fact.=E2=80=
=99</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CThe visitor shook his head. =E2=80=98No,=E2=80=99=

              <p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98That=E2=80=99s impossible,=E2=80=99 said=
 the writer. =E2=80=98You must know a story that has something to do with D=
on Quixote.=E2=80=99</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CThe visitor shrugged. =E2=80=98I might have,=E2=
=80=99 he said, =E2=80=98but I don=E2=80=99t remember it.=E2=80=99</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98Then you must tell it to me,=E2=80=99 sa=
id the writer. =E2=80=98If you don=E2=80=99t remember it, then you must mak=

              <p>=E2=80=9CThe visitor thought for a moment. =E2=80=98Will y=
ou accept it if I make it up?=E2=80=99 he said.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CThe writer leaned across the table and lit a ciga=
rette. =E2=80=98Yes,=E2=80=99 he said. =E2=80=98If you tell it to me, then =
it must be the truth. That=E2=80=99s how I see it. If I tell the story of D=

ee.=E2=80=99</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98All right,=E2=80=99 said the visitor. =
=E2=80=98I will try and tell you something that is the truth. But I don=E2=
=80=99t think it will sound like a story.=E2=80=99</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98I don=E2=80=99t care what it sounds like=
,=E2=80=99 said the writer. =E2=80=98It might be better if it doesn=E2=80=
=99t sound like a story. I might be able to imagine it, if you don=E2=80=99=
t tell the story line by line.=E2=80=99</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98All right,=E2=80=99 said the visitor. =
=E2=80=98Let me think for a moment.=E2=80=99</p>
              <p>=E2=80=A6The visitor got up and walked to the window and o=
pened it, and breathed the warm air in deeply. =E2=80=98I think I have it,=
=E2=80=99 he said. He sat down again and he closed his eyes, as if he were =
remembering something, and he was silent for a while, breathing deeply, enj=
oying feeling the air on his face, and then he appeared to fall asleep. The=
 writer watched him for a minute, and then he got up and opened the door an=
d called out to his wife. =E2=80=98Look what I did,=E2=80=99 he said, and h=
e ran out of the room.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CHe came back a few minutes later with a child=E2=
=80=99s bicycle, a tree stump, and a branch with a forked end. The visitor =
was still asleep. =E2=80=98I couldn=E2=80=99t find anything like a suit of =
armor,=E2=80=99 said the writer. =E2=80=98Or a cape. I brought a bicycle he=
lmet. I thought it had a medieval look to it, don=E2=80=99t you think?=E2=
=80=99</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CThe visitor opened one eye and then the other. He=
 looked at the writer and the bicycle and he smiled a little. =E2=80=98Yes,=
=E2=80=99 he said. =E2=80=98Maybe it does.=E2=80=99</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CThe writer put on the helmet and walked over to h=
im. =E2=80=98Take me to Don Quixote!=E2=80=99 he shouted. =E2=80=98Take me =
to Florinda! Go!=E2=80=99</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CHe reached down and grabbed the handle bars on th=
e bicycle and began pushing it forward, and he fell down on the floor laugh=
ing, and the visitor laughed too.</p>
              <p>The visitor smiled. =E2=80=98But I think I know how I shal=

ortant,=E2=80=99 he said, =E2=80=98to find the right beginning. I think tha=
t=E2=80=99s what the problem was all along. It sounds silly, but it=E2=80=

 Armor
              <br>
              Aslan was known for many things throughout Narnia, in the dif=
ferent worlds that he travelled to, and wherever else he may have gone. His=
 wisdom was perhaps the one thing that none could claim to match, his kindn=
ess one that they all desired to gain, his power and strength was nothing s=
hort of legendary, his courage would never give way in the face of any obst=
acle, and so on and so forth.
              <br>
              A true definition of a hero.
              <br>
              But no matter how great a hero, how incredible a legend he ma=
y have been, at the end of the day, he was still just a lion. He was strong=
, and yet he was mortal. With no true armour save for his own fur, no shiel=
d to protect him but his paws, he would have died protecting Narnia.
              <br>
              A noble death, certainly, but death nonetheless.
              <br>
              A foolish thing to have done for someone like him.
              <br>
              And yet, he wasn=E2=80=99t in Narnia. He was on Earth. He had=
 escaped from his slumber as a statue in a London museum in order to fight =
a battle for a girl named Son Son. A fight that he had lost.

              It wasn=E2=80=99t even that he had died in the fight. He was =
alive and conscious as he watched the destruction of the Earth by Lord Frie=
za=E2=80=99s minions on his home planet, still bound in the stone armour of=
 the museum, and even then he was still alive.
              <br>
              But they had blasted away the armour and then destroyed all t=
he cameras so he couldn=E2=80=99t show himself off as proof.
              <br>
              There was no where else to go from here. The Earth was gone n=
ow, probably leaving little but rocks floating through space. That left onl=
y one option for him to do. The obvious one. And yet=E2=80=A6
              <br>
              It wasn=E2=80=99t that he was afraid of death. He was a hero,=
 and heroes never die. They simply change into something better. Like the P=
evensies, only this time, it would be in a different world. Like Peter, Sus=
an, Edmund, and Lucy.
              <br>
              The trouble with this world was that there would be no one he=
re who would be able to get into Aslan=E2=80=99s world with him.
              <br>
              Or at least, no one that he could think of who would take him=
 there willingly. All the few people he could think of were either girls (a=
nd girls tended to be weak), or people that he had already failed to protec=
t.
              <br>
              It was something that he could think about later, though. Rig=
ht now, he had other things to focus on. Like where he would spend his last=
 hours alive.
              <br>
              The museum was fine, of course. It was where he had been for =
so long, anyways. It wasn=E2=80=99t as if he were going to leave it now, an=
yways. He just wanted to know that, after he died, the museum would continu=
e to last. Because he had a feeling that the best way to honor his memory w=
ould be to continue doing what he had done for so long here in London.
              <br>
              If he were somehow resurrected, he would give them a piece of=
 his mind if they had stopped trying to do that here, though.
              <br>
              There were also the cats. They were sweet creatures, but the =
last few days had not been kind to them. He wanted to make sure that they w=
ould find good homes once he was gone. There were plenty of people who coul=
d care for them, plenty who would find a family for a stray cat.
              <br>
              The other option was to simply give them up for adoption to a=
ny of his fans. Fans who loved him so much, who had idolized him for so lon=
g, that they would be willing to adopt cats just to carry on his memory. An=
d wouldn=E2=80=99t that be quite the memorable experience? To have Aslan ad=
opt you a cat! Surely any fan would jump at the chance!
              <br>
              Though, he would first have to make sure that they didn=E2=80=
=99t just kill the cat after a few days=E2=80=A6
              <br>
              But=E2=80=A6 the best way to be certain that someone would re=
member him forever would be to create a legacy.
              <br>
              Something that he could do without dying first.
              <br>
              That was his final thought before he fell asleep, finally giv=
ing up the struggle as he accepted his fate. As much as he tried, there was=
 no way for him to ever go back to Narnia again. And so, he would simply ha=
ve to find a new place to be.
              <br>
              Before he fell asleep, he resolved that, once he died, he wou=
ld search for a way to make sure that his memory was remembered. Perhaps it=
 would be easier for him to do that here on Earth, before it was too late, =
as opposed to waiting until he found himself in some new world where he kne=
w no one.
              <br>
              Perhaps=E2=80=A6 perhaps it was best to start now.
              <br>
              Author=E2=80=99s Note: So yeah. This is something that I=E2=
=80=99ve been wanting to write for a while, actually. I wanted to do a rebo=
ot of an older idea that I had, back when I didn=E2=80=99t think that it wa=
s a good idea to continue NGE=E2=80=99s story in an alternate universe.
              <br>
              I decided that it might be best to start now, though, instead=
 of later.
              <br>
              The basic premise is that, instead of being born on Earth, So=
n Goku is instead born in a different world, where Aslan finds him and rais=
es him as his son. Things obviously end up differently than in canon, but a=
t the end of the day, Goku is still Goku.
              <br>
              Now, there are plenty of Crossover crossovers for this out th=
ere, like Aslan the Saiyajin , or Son Goku and the Kingdom of Narnia .
              <br>
              The thing is, though, I don=E2=80=99t want to do that.
              <br>
              What I want to do is to do this with a G-rated =E2=80=9Chappy=
 ending=E2=80=9D instead. The whole point of this is to find ways to help N=
arnia/=E2=80=8BLondon=E2=80=99s reputation after Goku is introduced to the =
world in the first two chapters. That way, the main conflict of this will b=
e finding ways to keep London=E2=80=99s reputation, with Goku being dragged=
 along for the ride.
              <br>
              Now, if you have questions about this story, such as, =E2=80=
=9CAre you going to do an adaptation of Goku from Dragon Ball Z ?=E2=80=9D =
then the answer is no. This story is only going to deal with the Son Goku t=
hat everyone knows and loves from Dragon Ball .
              <br>
              I=E2=80=99m also going to try out something different, by mak=
ing sure that every chapter of this story is self-contained. That way, in c=
ase my updates get erratic, you won=E2=80=99t be left hanging by what=E2=80=
=99s going on.
              <br>
              Also, if you have any thoughts about this story, leave a revi=
ew with them! I=E2=80=99d love to see what you think of this idea!
              <br>
              Well, that=E2=80=99s it for today. See ya!
              <br>

              <br>
              A/=E2=80=8BN: For those of you who aren=E2=80=99t aware, this=
 is a fusion of the book The Voyage of the Dawn Treader with the anime Drag=
on Ball Z. The Dawn Treader universe and the Dragon Ball universe are like =
parallel universes. So, it would make sense if they crossed over in the mul=
tiverse at some point. This is the first story in a series that I=E2=80=99m=
 calling =E2=80=98Aslan=E2=80=99s Final Form.=E2=80=99 In this series, Asla=
n finally loses his patience with the state of his creation and enters the =
Dragon Ball universe in an effort to restore his image. This story is all a=
bout Aslan=E2=80=99s perspective on how everything went down, because the t=
ruth of the matter is that Aslan wasn=E2=80=99t really in control of his ac=
tions at all. This story is going to be told in the first person, from Asla=
n=E2=80=99s perspective.</p>
              <p>=E2=80=9CYou all do not yet realize your situation. You th=
ink you do, but you do not.=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94Aslan, The Lion, the Witch, an=
d the Wardrobe</p>
              <p>I can=E2=80=99t believe it. I can=E2=80=99t believe what I=
 have to deal with now. I gave humans freedom and the result is this? Even =
with my full powers restored, I can=E2=80=99t even get these people to resp=
ect me anymore. What happened? When did things go so wrong?</p>
              <p>I guess it all started with that rat. Oh, you=E2=80=99re p=
robably wondering what this has to do with anything. It might seem like it=
=E2=80=99s only tangentially related, but everything will come back around,=
 I promise. The story of my death and resurrection will end up making sense=
, even if it doesn=E2=80=99t right now. I guess I should start by explainin=
g who I am. My name is Aslan, and I am the High King of Narnia.</p>
              <p>My father was a god called Zeus, and he and my mother had =
another son who was just as powerful as I was called Hercules. The three of=
 us were always getting into trouble when we were growing up, and we travel=
ed all over the world doing crazy things. We were always competing to see w=
ho was the strongest of us three, even though we were pretty evenly matched=
. The one thing that bothered me was that Hercules was always looking for a=
n excuse to hit me, but we always worked things out when we got back home.<=
/p>
              <p>One day, Hercules and I were having a friendly spar in the=
 gym that had been built in our palace, and we were practicing using our go=
dly energy. Zeus had created a special sword for me that was filled with my=
 energy, and I couldn=E2=80=99t use my powers as well without it. I guess i=
t was my pride that made me lose control and try to attack Hercules without=
 using my sword, but he was so quick that I couldn=E2=80=99t touch him. My =
sword ended up flying out of my hands, and it went right through the throne=
 room window and into the street below. It was at that moment that everythi=
ng changed.</p>
              <p>Hercules was holding a ball of godly energy in his hand an=
d swung it at my head. I guess he thought he would be able to do a cool mov=
e like Goku and knock me out with one hit. I had been moving my head to the=
 side, so the ball of energy went right by me and shattered the throne room=
 window. I didn=E2=80=99t realize at the time, but the ball of energy was c=
arrying divine power from me and Hercules into the streets of Narnia. It wa=
s at that moment that a human boy named Eustace fell through the window and=
 into our world. The boy had been flying his model airplane around the city=
, and the impact sent him right through the window. I didn=E2=80=99t realiz=
e what had happened at first, and I called for someone to take care of the =
boy. His mother came running in the room, and she scooped him up and took h=
im home. The boy was completely unconscious when he left.</p>
              <p>I had completely forgotten about the boy when he returned =
to our world several hours later. He was riding on a griffin, but he fell o=
ff in the throne room and hit his head. I came over to see if he was all ri=
ght, but Hercules kicked him in the face and tried to kill him. I got betwe=
en them and stopped Hercules, but I didn=E2=80=99t understand why he was do=
ing it in the first place. It turns out that the godly energy that had come=
 from Hercules=E2=80=99 ball of energy had given Eustace godly powers when =
he fell through the window. Since Eustace is human, his powers were very di=
fferent from mine, but he did share some of my abilities. My first inclinat=
ion was to get rid of him, but then I realized that maybe I could use him. =
I figured that there were only a few ways to get humans to listen to me aga=
in, and I thought maybe it would work if I teamed up with someone who had a=
 similar power level to mine.</p>
              <p>I explained to Eustace that he had special powers, and I t=
old him how to activate them. He asked me how he could access them, and I t=
ried to be as vague as possible about it. I wasn=E2=80=99t about to give aw=
ay my secrets to someone like that, but I didn=E2=80=99t want him to suspec=
t anything. After all, he was a human and would never understand how godly =
power works.</p>
              <p>Eustace became a warrior named =E2=80=9CThe Digger=E2=80=
=9D who fought evil dragons and rescued damsels in distress. The man loved =
adventure, and he used his powers to help people. In a lot of ways, he was =
similar to a Dragon Ball Z character called Goku, who is also a warrior fig=
hting against the forces of evil. Unlike Goku, The Digger wasn=E2=80=99t su=
per smart and didn=E2=80=99t understand that killing dragons was bad for th=
e ecosystem. He never would have let that happen if he had been in charge, =
but he did a lot of good for the people of Narnia, even if he was a bit rec=
kless about it. I was impressed with the man=E2=80=99s work, and I kept my =
distance to avoid suspicion. I kept an eye on him, but I never made contact=
. I would have loved to have used him as a pawn against my enemies, but I c=
ouldn=E2=80=99t take that risk.</p>
              <p>Years later, Eustace=E2=80=99s wife and children became in=
volved in The Digger=E2=80=99s adventures. He began using them in his battl=
es, and he never even stopped to think about what was happening to them. I =
had always wanted kids of my own, but the idea of my children fighting to t=
he death just for my own entertainment was abhorrent to me.</p>
              <p>Even though I didn=E2=80=99t get involved directly with Th=
e Digger, I still cared about his family. It hurt me to see them having to =
deal with all the fighting and fighting themselves. They really were a stro=
ng family, and they were just as important to me as my own family had been.=
 That=E2=80=99s why I decided to take direct action. I had planned to kill =
all of them after their final battle, but then I realized that I could kill=
 two birds with one stone.</p>
              <p>I met with Hercules in private and told him what I was pla=
nning. I explained that I wanted his help in destroying The Digger and his =
family for the sake of justice. He had been watching them for</p>

              <p>Suddenly, this new poetry burst onto the scene and it comp=
letely revolutionized the way that poetry was looked at by not only the Kor=
eans but by all of Asia. Poets all over the land now wanted to be as good a=
s the Hahoe Poets. It has been said that Hahoe created a renaissance in Kor=
ean Literature and the effect of this can be seen today in modern Korea.</p=
>
              <p>However, many of the great thinkers in Korean history came=
 from the Hahoe Poetry Society.</p>
              <p>That is one of the reasons that Hahoe is considered to be =
so important to Korea=E2=80=99s past.</p>

            <p>Note: the Hahoe poets do not exist, although there is a hist=
orical village of that name in South Korea. The quoted poem echoes the famo=
us passage from the <a href=3D"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Sutra"=

but aside from that, <em>seems</em> to be original. (It is such a short gat=

 [p.&nbsp;81]</p>
              <p>Apart from the meaning, every single word and letter of wh=
ich has a distinct purpose, this sentence has a rhythm that is perfectly cr=
afted. The iambic pentameter. The play on sounds. The titillating sounds of=
 =E2=80=9Csomber=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Ccadaver=E2=80=9D in the context. One=
 by one the words in the sentence evoke emotions, sadness, foreboding, a ta=
ste of something disturbing, a foreshadowing of something to come. This cou=
ld not be mimicked. No one who is not John Milton can do this.</p>
              <p>There is also a lot of Miltonic word-play. Here is another=
 example:</p>
              <p>Nor the dark Laws of Democritus
              <br>
              That say nor sight, nor feeling, false or true,
              <br>
              Where the mind errs, no less errs that which interprets it, [=
p.&nbsp;65]</p>
              <p>The word =E2=80=9Cinterpret=E2=80=9D is commonly used to m=
ean =E2=80=9Ctranslates=E2=80=9D (a word referring to classical or literary=
 translations) which is somewhat true in the context here. However, apart f=
rom that, the verb =E2=80=9Cinterpret=E2=80=9D also refers to the work of t=
he clergy, and more specifically, that of a priest who performs confession =
and places a penitent under an interdict (a prayer to God to withhold spiri=
tual gifts from the penitent till he/=E2=80=8Bshe repents) The style of the=
 writing is such that it alternates between the verse and the prose. Milton=
 uses the verse for more dense, emphatic, and descriptive writing, and the =
prose for some kind of commentary.</p>
              <p>To what purpose serves the exercise in verse?</p>
              <p>For Milton, unlike any other writer of the preceding eras,=
 and all of the writers after him (notably Wordsworth and Whitman), the fre=
e verse, whether the iambic pentameter or not, is an end in itself, it is a=
rt.</p>

              <p>5. Bunker</p>
              <p>It was not easy to find any project related to Bunker, the=
 company behind the software for interactive fiction. I am not very familia=
r with the concept of =E2=80=9Cinteractive fiction=E2=80=9D. I had to Googl=
e. interactive fiction is a computer game genre. In computer game terms int=
eractive fiction is =E2=80=9Ca type of video game (usually a text adventure=
) in which the game world is displayed in text that can be searched, examin=
ed, or traversed.=E2=80=9D</p>
              <p>This means that text interaction is clearly the core of Bu=
nker=E2=80=99s solution.</p>
              <p>The video that follows, is a presentation of a part of the=
 Bunker software and it=E2=80=99s capabilities. If it is a bit hard to unde=
rstand, I would still recommend you to watch it because it=E2=80=99s the mo=
st intuitive way of showing a typical Bunker application.</p>
              <p>The high level concept is very simple: it allows you to ea=
sily create and publish an interactive story in any device.</p>
              <p>I am not 100% familiar with the capabilities of this softw=
are, but I like the idea of having access to a framework that can be used t=
o quickly create story driven applications.</p>
              <p>Some the key features of Bunker are:</p>
              <p>Free Web Player</p>
              <p>Content editor/=E2=80=8Bserver built in HTML</p>

              <p>iOS and Android application publishing</p>
              <p>I suspect that in some ways it may work in a similar way a=
s Twine, that means, the editor can be used for both content creation and p=
lay.</p>
              <p>6. Wattpad</p>
              <p>Wattpad seems to be a very popular site for the sharing of=
 original and fan fiction (they have over 5 million readers and 50 million =
unique visitors monthly, very cool).</p>
              <p>It has been growing like crazy: in 2012, the site had 200,=
000 stories; in 2013 it had 7 million. There are millions of users using th=
e platform and from those, a million are active story authors.</p>
              <p>They have this thing called the Wattpad Stars where they g=
ive one of the top authors a $100,000 grant, to encourage other authors. Th=
is page has a description of all the winners:</p>
              <p>I really like this approach, it=E2=80=99s definitely diffe=
rent from what we are used to.</p>
              <p>From a developer perspective I am also interested in their=
 API: http:/=E2=80=8B/=E2=80=8Bwattpad.com/=E2=80=8Bapi. This is what they =

              <p>It doesn=E2=80=99t look like a normal string at all, it is=
 what I call a monolithic composition, it has a very specific way of parsin=

few commands, if it is given a different command:</p>

              <p>It doesn=E2=80=99t parse correctly, what is the format tha=
t the development team use for such compositions?</p>
              <p>They would use an environment that looks like this:</p>
              <p>The top blue panel is the console, this is where the input=
 commands will be entered, commands may include any sequences and event han=
dlers, the second blue panel is the debugger, the debugger would display vi=
sual information about the state of the console, the top panel would have a=
 tree view of the console, where blue nodes in the tree view would be the c=
ommands the user is able to execute, the debugger also should be able to pa=
use the environment and reveal the state of the execution and to resume nor=
mal execution.</p>
              <p>If the user wants to create an application for the applica=
tion he would go into the application create screen, this would look like s=
o:</p>
              <p>The application composition screen is the top panel, this =
screen will display the tree view of the composition, the code block is whe=
re the user would type his application source code, he would be able to put=
 comments inside his application source code, and the grey box is where he =
would see the execution of his application, again the debugger should be ab=
le to pause the execution and display the state of his application.</p>
              <p>That is it for today, I will write more about other parts =
of the system and how I envision it.</p>

              <p>The BPE encoding would not devote much space to Cyrillic B=
PEs. BPEs usually include 256 BPEs for encoding the 2<sup>8</sup> =3D 256 p=

 case, it might fall back to encoding individual UTF-8 Unicode bytes, poten=
tially encoding each character as no less than <em>4</em> BPEs! In the spec=
ific case of Cyrillic, UTF-8 spends 2 bytes per Cyrillic character, so GPT-=
3 would have a context window of ~1024 characters, or &lt;190 words. Extrem=

sees that the non-comma numbers are considered somehow intrinsically very u=

haps GPT-3 learns arithmetic primarily from financial or business-related w=

              <p>The BPE encoding would not devote much space to Cyrillic B=

ific case of Cyrillic, UTF-8 spends 2 bytes per Cyrillic character, so GPT-=
3 would have a context window of ~1024 characters, or &lt;190 words. Extrem=

              <p>This is ironic, because Turing made his interlocutor get t=
he wrong answer too: 34,957 + 70,764 =3D 105,<em>7</em>21. Incidentally, in=
 light of my BPE/=E2=80=8Btemperature/=E2=80=8BBO comments, one might wonde=
r if the dialogue settings underestimate GPT-3=E2=80=99s arithmetic, even t=
hought GPT-3 reliably gets it wrong? =E2=80=9CSampling can show the presenc=
e of knowledge, but not its absence.=E2=80=9D</p>
              <p>If I add commas, lower the temperature to 0.15, use BO =3D=
 20, I get: <code>34,957 + 70,764 =3D| $34,957 + $70,764 =3D $105,721</code=
>. And if one uses the Playground=E2=80=99s probability visualization, one =
sees that the non-comma numbers are considered somehow intrinsically very u=
nlikely, and it has low confidence in any of its (always wrong) answers, wh=
ile with comma numbers, the numbers &amp; answers are much more likely. Per=
haps GPT-3 learns arithmetic primarily from financial or business-related w=
ritings, where there will be countless numbers, many of which are closely r=
elated to each other (such as by being sums or multiples of earlier numbers=
), which would provide an incentive to learn general arithmetic since it ca=

              <p>I like =E2=80=9Cprompt programming=E2=80=9D as a descripti=
on of writing GPT-3 prompts because =E2=80=98prompt=E2=80=99 (like =E2=80=
=98dynamic programming=E2=80=99) has almost purely positive connotations; i=
t indicates that iteration is <em>fast</em> as the meta-learning avoids the=
 need for training so you get feedback in seconds; it reminds us that GPT-3=
 is a =E2=80=9Cweird machine=E2=80=9D which we have to have =E2=80=9Cmechan=
ical sympathy=E2=80=9D to understand effective use of (eg. how BPEs distort=
 its understanding of text and how it is always trying to roleplay as rando=

loped, tested, version-controlled, and which can be buggy &amp; slow like a=
ny other programs, capable of great improvement; that it=E2=80=99s an art y=

st thoughtless essentializing of GPT-3 (any output is the joint outcome of =
the prompt, sampling processes, models, and human interpretation of said ou=

                <br>
                When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkne=

                <br>
                And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and door=

                <br>
                And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and her=

                <br>
                Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused =

                Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou=

                <br>
                By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east =

                <br>
                Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of water=

                <br>
                To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the w=
ilderness, wherein there is no man;
                <br>
                To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the =

                <br>
                Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of d=
ew?
                <br>
                Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heav=

                <br>
                The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the dee=

                <br>
                Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose =

                <br>
                Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst th=

                <br>
                Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the d=
ominion thereof in the earth?
                <br>
                Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance =
of waters may cover thee?
                <br>
                Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto =
thee, Here we are?
                <br>
                Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given =
understanding to the heart?
                <br>
                Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bo=
ttles of heaven,
                <br>
                When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave f=
ast together?
                <br>
                Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite =
of the young lions,
                <br>
                When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to l=
ie in wait?
                <br>
                Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones c=
ry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.
