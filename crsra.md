### Week 1 - the escalator

Write a scene of 250-350 words featuring a character with **one concrete want** (a table, a moose, a toothbrush, anything physical is fine!) and **one weakness**. Use these two features to drive the action of the plot. Set up the story where every other sentence is a rising action. To help you come up with rising actions, use one word from the following list of twelve words in each sentence that has a rising action. In other words: Write your first sentence introducing your character. Make the next sentence a rising action using one of the following twelve words. Write your third sentence, which may introduce the weakness, then write your fourth sentence with a rising action that includes one of the remaining eleven words you haven’t used. And so on.

You must use at least 6 of the 12 words, but you are encouraged to challenge yourself to use as many of the words as possible while still meeting the word count.

### Week 2 - ABDCE


Write a very short story - not more than 200 words - about a trip to the doctor or dentist using the ABDCE structure. Identify the structural elements in your story. My example is provided below:

* Action: This is the inciting incident which sets off the story in motion.
* Background: What happened to the characters in the past that made them what they are today.
* Development: The course of the story where the characters chase their goals.
* Climax: This is the point where the goals are achieved with dramatic consequences.
* Ending: All the loose threads in the plot are tied up.


### Week 3 - Scenes 

Thinking, feeling and processing    

* Action
* Dialogue
* Intimate detail (advance plot/character)
* Inner point of view (3R: react reflect reveal)
* Start / End point
Physical details / incarnation


As with the first assignment, you will create another scene where someone wants a concrete physical object more than anything else in the world. This time, instead of focusing on rising action entirely, consider the full story structure.

Write for a few minutes, then give that character a disease where they learn they have only 24 hours to live. This is your first significant rising action.

Write some more, then give that character a choice between that object and an antidote. This is your second significant rising action.

Finish the story with a conclusion. Your final story should not exceed 500 words. If you are considering participating in the capstone and have a larger story in mind, you can consider this an opportunity to write one scene from it, but remember your reader will not have any outside context.

Week 3

Bran had never seen the crows behaving that strangely. The corvid lab’s guests was really quiet this morning, and stayed at a distance when he entered the playground. Bran was trying to find a common language with his feathered friends, especially Gwern, as the biologist-nerd he called himself. Why would we explore the cosmos to chat with aliens when we have intelligence species down here ? A new day here might hold the key to their Rosetta stone, the quest of his life. The computer hummed a bit too noisily to life, and another day began.

He was observing silent Korbak opening a puzzle box when his mobile rang. His GP, a welsh witch called Penarddun, popped to existence. Only bad news. She never called on video for good news.
- Bran, I’m sorry. You’ve been caught in a conspiracy. Matholwch has been angry with you since this business with Efnysien. You’re collateral damages. And cursed. Unless you get the Pair Dadeni cauldron, you’ll die within 24 hours.
- But noone has seen the PD for a while now ! Where’s the damn thing ?
- The whole gang is looking for it – we’ll let you know as soon as we find it.

A loud series of caws and kraas, and a flurry of wings on the table. Gwern looked perturbed, excitingly hopping on the lab’s table. Sounds came out of the laptop speakers : « man, bad, man, bad, pot, bad ». 
But was Bran heard was «  F**  Matholwch and his choices ! You talked much about him, not a good one ! ».

Baffled, Bran sat down on his chair. Gwern was cursing over and over. He wondered if the curse did not get a hidden blessing – answering his only wish.  
- Gwern, do you understand what I say ?
- Of course ! We’re not as stupid as you can think – we’ve managed to fool you for so long. But once you’re gone, who is going to feed us these tasty treats ?
Matholwch was evil, no doubt about that. But this curse ? Being able to talk with ravens, only for a day, discover that they were as complex as humans, and then vanish from existence ? A whole new world just was opening !

Later this day, Penarddun called back :
- Efnisien found the Pair Dadeni
- Thanks so much Pen ! And so much has been …
– but somehow it had been damaged. You’ll still die, but going through it will cause your rebirth – coming back as a child, with no memory.
Luckily, Bran was a researcher. So he tried to think.

It had indeed been a long night. Pen had brought the cauldron with her at the lab, leaving him enough time to take notes as much as possible before ... . He had felt Gwern circle around him before dying from the curse, and saw himself thrown in the cauldron.

It was now a new dawn. He could not remember his name, but he was alive again. He cawed in delight, and straighten his feathers. A superb day indeed.
